Once upon a time there was a DOS user who saw Unix, and saw that it was
good.  After typing cp on his DOS machine at home, he downloaded GNU's
unix tools ported to DOS and installed them.  He rm'd, cp'd, and mv'd
happily for many days, and upon finding elvis, he vi'd and was happy.  After
a long day at work (on a Unix box) he came home, started editing a file,
and couldn't figure out why he couldn't suspend vi (w/ ctrl-z) to do
a compile.

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Other than the fact Linux has a cool name, could someone explain why I

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; No.  That's it.  The cool name, that is.  We worked very hard on
&amp;gt; creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it
&amp;gt; certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able
&amp;gt; to say &amp;quot;OS/2? Hah.  I've got Linux.  What a cool name&amp;quot;.  386BSD made the
&amp;gt; mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the
&amp;gt; name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too
&amp;gt; technical.
	-- Linus Torvalds' follow-up to a question about Linux
</string><string>
&amp;gt; The day people think linux would be better served by somebody else (FSF
&amp;gt; being the natural alternative), I'll &amp;quot;abdicate&amp;quot;.  I don't think that
&amp;gt; it's something people have to worry about right now - I don't see it
&amp;gt; happening in the near future.  I enjoy doing linux, even though it does
&amp;gt; mean some work, and I haven't gotten any complaints (some almost timid
&amp;gt; reminders about a patch I have forgotten or ignored, but nothing
&amp;gt; negative so far).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Don't take the above to mean that I'll stop the day somebody complains:
&amp;gt; I'm thick-skinned (Lasu, who is reading this over my shoulder commented
&amp;gt; that &amp;quot;thick-HEADED is closer to the truth&amp;quot;) enough to take some abuse.
&amp;gt; If I weren't, I'd have stopped developing linux the day ast ridiculed me
&amp;gt; on c.o.minix.  What I mean is just that while linux has been my baby so
&amp;gt; far, I don't want to stand in the way if people want to make something
&amp;gt; better of it (*).

   overworked, and he makes lousy patches, but we love him anyway&amp;quot;. Get
   your spuouse to do this too for extra effect.  Children are optional.
 - Apply the patch included in this mail
 - Call your system &amp;quot;Super-67&amp;quot;, and don't forget to unapply the patch
   before you later applying the official 1.3.68 patch.

	-- Linus Torvalds announcing 2.0.27
</string><string>
AP/STT.  Helsinki, Dec 5th, 6:22 AM.  For immediate release.

In order to allay fears about the continuity of the Linux project, Linus
Torvalds together with his manager Tove Monni have released &amp;quot;Linus
v2.0&amp;quot;, affectionately known as &amp;quot;Kernel Hacker - The Next Generation&amp;quot;.

Linux stock prices on Wall Street rose sharply after the announcement;
as one well-known analyst who wishes to remain anonymous says - &amp;quot;It
shows a long-term commitment, and while we expect a short-term decrease
in productivity, we feel that this solidifies the development in the
long run&amp;quot;.

Other analysts downplay the importance of the event, and claim that just
about anybody could have done it.  &amp;quot;I'm glad somebody finally told them
about the birds and the bees&amp;quot; one sceptic comments cryptically.  But
even the skeptics agree that it is an interesting turn of events.

Others bring up other issues with the new version - &amp;quot;I'm especially
intrigued by the fact that the new version is female, and look forward
to seeing what the impact of that will be on future development.  Will
&amp;quot;Red Hat Linux&amp;quot; change to &amp;quot;Pink Hat Linux&amp;quot;, for example?&amp;quot;
