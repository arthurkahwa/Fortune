Once upon a time there was a DOS user who saw Unix, and saw that it was
good.  After typing cp on his DOS machine at home, he downloaded GNU's
unix tools ported to DOS and installed them.  He rm'd, cp'd, and mv'd
happily for many days, and upon finding elvis, he vi'd and was happy.  After
a long day at work (on a Unix box) he came home, started editing a file,
and couldn't figure out why he couldn't suspend vi (w/ ctrl-z) to do
a compile.

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Other than the fact Linux has a cool name, could someone explain why I
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; should use Linux over BSD?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; No.  That's it.  The cool name, that is.  We worked very hard on
&amp;gt; creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it
&amp;gt; certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able
&amp;gt; to say &amp;quot;OS/2? Hah.  I've got Linux.  What a cool name&amp;quot;.  386BSD made the
&amp;gt; mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the
&amp;gt; name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too
&amp;gt; technical.
	-- Linus Torvalds' follow-up to a question about Linux
</string><string>
&amp;gt; The day people think linux would be better served by somebody else (FSF
&amp;gt; being the natural alternative), I'll &amp;quot;abdicate&amp;quot;.  I don't think that
&amp;gt; it's something people have to worry about right now - I don't see it
&amp;gt; happening in the near future.  I enjoy doing linux, even though it does
&amp;gt; mean some work, and I haven't gotten any complaints (some almost timid
&amp;gt; reminders about a patch I have forgotten or ignored, but nothing
&amp;gt; negative so far).
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Don't take the above to mean that I'll stop the day somebody complains:
&amp;gt; I'm thick-skinned (Lasu, who is reading this over my shoulder commented
&amp;gt; that &amp;quot;thick-HEADED is closer to the truth&amp;quot;) enough to take some abuse.
&amp;gt; If I weren't, I'd have stopped developing linux the day ast ridiculed me
&amp;gt; on c.o.minix.  What I mean is just that while linux has been my baby so
&amp;gt; far, I don't want to stand in the way if people want to make something
&amp;gt; better of it (*).

Keep me informed on the behaviour of this kernel..  As the &amp;quot;BugFree(tm)&amp;quot;
series didn't turn out too well, I'm starting a new series called the
&amp;quot;ItWorksForMe(tm)&amp;quot; series, of which this new kernel is yet another
shining example.

get a fully working kernel, you have to follow the steps below:

   overworked, and he makes lousy patches, but we love him anyway&amp;quot;. Get
   your spuouse to do this too for extra effect.  Children are optional.
 - Apply the patch included in this mail
 - Call your system &amp;quot;Super-67&amp;quot;, and don't forget to unapply the patch
   before you later applying the official 1.3.68 patch.

	-- Linus Torvalds announcing 2.0.27
</string><string>
AP/STT.  Helsinki, Dec 5th, 6:22 AM.  For immediate release.

In order to allay fears about the continuity of the Linux project, Linus
Torvalds together with his manager Tove Monni have released &amp;quot;Linus
v2.0&amp;quot;, affectionately known as &amp;quot;Kernel Hacker - The Next Generation&amp;quot;.

Linux stock prices on Wall Street rose sharply after the announcement;
as one well-known analyst who wishes to remain anonymous says - &amp;quot;It
shows a long-term commitment, and while we expect a short-term decrease
in productivity, we feel that this solidifies the development in the
long run&amp;quot;.

Other analysts downplay the importance of the event, and claim that just
about anybody could have done it.  &amp;quot;I'm glad somebody finally told them
about the birds and the bees&amp;quot; one sceptic comments cryptically.  But
even the skeptics agree that it is an interesting turn of events.

Others bring up other issues with the new version - &amp;quot;I'm especially
intrigued by the fact that the new version is female, and look forward
to seeing what the impact of that will be on future development.  Will
&amp;quot;Red Hat Linux&amp;quot; change to &amp;quot;Pink Hat Linux&amp;quot;, for example?&amp;quot;

Winnuke in one line?  No problem:

And formatted so it's a little easier to read:

        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use IO::Socket;
        IO::Socket::INET
                -&amp;gt;new(PeerAddr=&amp;gt;&amp;quot;bad.dude.com:139&amp;quot;)

		<string>Gay shlafen:  Yiddish for &quot;go to sleep&quot;.

Now doesn&apos;t &quot;gay shlafen&quot; have a softer, more soothing sound than the
harsh, staccato &quot;go to sleep&quot;?  Listen to the difference:
	&quot;Go to sleep, you little wretch!&quot; ... &quot;Gay shlafen, darling.&quot;
Obvious, isn&apos;t it?
	Clearly the best thing you can do for you children is to start
speaking Yiddish right now and never speak another word of English as
long as you live.  This will, of course, entail teaching Yiddish to all
your friends, business associates, the people at the supermarket, and
so on, but that&apos;s just the point.  It has to start with committed
individuals and then grow....
	Some minor adjustments will have to be made, of course: those
signs written in what look like Yiddish letters won&apos;t be funny when
everything is written in Yiddish.  And we&apos;ll have to start driving on
the left side of the road so we won&apos;t be reading the street signs
backwards.  But is that too high a price to pay for world peace?
I think not, my friend, I think not.

imagine they were in Topeka Kansas.

		<string>	Some 1500 miles west of the Big Apple we find the Minneapple, a
haven of tranquility in troubled times.  It&apos;s a good town, a civilized town.
A town where they still know how to get your shirts back by Thursday.  Let
the Big Apple have the feats of &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; Namath.  We have known the
stolid but steady Killebrew.  Listening to Cole Porter over a dry martini
may well suit those unlucky enough never to have heard the Whoopee John Polka
Band and never to have shared a pitcher of 3.2 Grain Belt Beer.  The loss is
theirs.  And the Big Apple has yet to bake the bagel that can match peanut
butter on lefse.  Here is a town where the major urban problem is dutch elm
disease and the number one crime is overtime parking.  We boast more theater
per capita than the Big Apple.  We go to see, not to be seen.  We go even
when we must shovel ten inches of snow from the driveway to get there.  Indeed
the winters are fierce.  But then comes the marvel of the Minneapple summer.
People flock to the city&apos;s lakes to frolic and rejoice at the sight of so
much happy humanity free from the bonds of the traditional down-filled parka.
Here&apos;s to the Minneapple.  And to its people.  Our flair for style is balanced
by a healthy respect for wind chill factors.
	And we always, always eat our vegetables.
	This is the Minneapple.

stadium for the first game of the World Series only to realize he had left
his ticket at home.  Not wanting to miss any of the first inning, he went
to the ticket booth and got in a long line for another seat.  After an hour&apos;s
wait he was just a few feet from the booth when a voice called out, &quot;Hey,
Dave!&quot;  The Aggie looked up, stepped out of line and tried to find the owner
of the voice -- with no success.   Then he realized he had lost his place in
line and had to wait all over again.  When the fan finally bought his ticket,
he was thirsty, so he went to buy a drink.  The line at the concession stand
was long, too, but since the game hadn&apos;t started he decided to wait.  Just as
he got to the window, a voice called out, &quot;Hey, Dave!&quot;  Again the Aggie tried
to find the voice -- but no luck.  He was very upset as he got back in line
for his drink.  Finally the fan went to his seat, eager for the game to begin.
As he waited for the pitch, he heard the voice calling, &quot;Hey Dave!&quot; once more.
Furious, he stood up and yelled at the top of his lungs,  &quot;My name isn&apos;t Dave!&quot;

It is my contention that, if this definition be accepted, there is no country
in the world wherein a man constituted as I am -- a man of my peculiar
weaknesses, vanities, appetites, and aversions -- can be so happy as he can
be in the United States.  Going further, I lay down the doctrine that it is

If you like the fortune program, why not support it now with your
contribution of a pithy fortunes, clean or obscene?  We cannot continue
without your support.  Less than 14% of all fortune users are contributors.
That means that 86% of you are getting a free ride.  We can&apos;t go on like
this much longer.  Federal cutbacks mean less money for fortunes, and unless
user contributions increase to make up the difference, the fortune program

		<string>	A circus foreman was making the rounds inspecting the big top
when a scrawny little man entered the tent and walked up to him.  &quot;Are 
you the foreman around here?&quot; he asked timidly.  &quot;I&apos;d like to join your
circus; I have what I think is a pretty good act.&quot;
	The foreman nodded assent, whereupon the little man hurried over to
the main pole and rapidly climbed up to the very tip-top of the big top.
Drawing a deep breath, he hurled himself off into the air and began flapping
his arms furiously.  Amazingly, rather than plummeting to his death the little
man began to fly all around the poles, lines, trapezes and other obstacles,
performing astounding feats of aerobatics which ended in a long power dive
from the top of the tent, pulling up into a gentle feet-first landing beside
the foreman, who had been nonchalantly watching the whole time.
	&quot;Well,&quot; puffed the little man.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;
	&quot;That&apos;s all you do?&quot; answered the foreman scornfully.  &quot;Bird
imitations?&quot;

to be published or even performed until a year had elapsed after his death.

	Most of us know the &quot;Swan&quot; movement rather well, with its smooth,
flowing cello melody against a calm background; but I&apos;ve been having this

	What if he had written this piece with lyrics, as a song to be sung?
And, further, what if he had accompanied this song with a musical saw?  (This

		<string>Hoaars-Faisse Gallery presents:
An exhibit of works by the artist known only as Pretzel.

The exhibit includes several large conceptual works using non-traditional
media and found objects including old sofa-beds, used mace canisters,
discarded sanitary napkins and parts of freeways.  The artist explores
our dehumanization due to high technology and unresponsive governmental
structures in a post-industrial world.  She/he (the artist prefers to
remain without gender) strives to create dialogue between viewer and
creator, to aid us in our quest to experience contemporary life with its
inner-city tensions, homelessness, global warming and gender and
class-based stress.  The works are arranged to lead us to the essence of
the argument: that the alienation of the person/machine boundary has
sapped the strength of our voices and must be destroyed for society to
exist in a more fundamental sense.

		<string>I remember once being on a station platform in Cleveland at four in the
morning.  A black porter was carrying my bags, and as we were waiting for
the train to come in, he said to me: &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Cooke, I don&apos;t want to
invade your privacy, but I have a bet with a friend of mine.  Who composed
the opening theme music of &apos;Omnibus&apos;?  My friend said Virgil Thomson.&quot;  I
asked him, &quot;What do you say?&quot; He replied, &quot;I say Aaron Copeland.&quot; I said,
&quot;You&apos;re right.&quot;  The porter said,  &quot;I knew Thomson doesn&apos;t write counterpoint
that way.&quot;  I told that to a network president, and he was deeply unimpressed.

		<string>  I. Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of
     its situation.
	Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.  He
	loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to
	look down.  At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per
	second per second takes over.
 II. Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
     intervenes suddenly.
	Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon
	characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a telephone
	pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward motion absolutely.
	Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the
	stooge&apos;s surcease.
III. Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
     conforming to its perimeter.
	Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
	speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless
	cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through
	the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole.  The
	threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.

		<string>IV. The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or
    equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to
    spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.
	Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture it
	inevitably unsuccessful.
 V. All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
	Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel
	them directly away from the earth&apos;s surface.  A spooky noise or an
	adversary&apos;s signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to
	the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.
	The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding
	auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.
VI. As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
	This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a
	character&apos;s head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of
	altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common
	as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled.  A &quot;wacky&quot;
	character has the option of self-replication only at manic high
	speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.

		<string>	Lassie looked brilliant, in part because the farm family she

sleeves, and they&apos;d always waste precious minutes saying things: &quot;Do
you think something&apos;s wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow her?
What is it, girl?&quot;, etc., as if this had never happened before, instead

		<string>My band career ended late in my senior year when John Cooper and I threw my
amplifier out the dormitory window.  We did not act in haste. First we
checked to make sure the amplifier would fit through the frame, using the
belt from my bathrobe to measure, then we picked up the amplifier and backed
up to my bedroom door.  Then we rushed forward, shouting &quot;The WHO!  The
WHO!&quot; and we launched my amplifier perfectly, as though we had been doing it
all our lives, clean through the window and down onto the sidewalk, where a
small but appreciative crowd had gathered.  I would like to be able to say
that this was a symbolic act, an effort on my part to break cleanly away
from one state in my life and move on to another, but the truth is, Cooper
and I really just wanted to find out what it would sound like.  It sounded

		<string>Potahto&apos; Pictures Productions Presents:

	SPUD ROGERS OF THE 25TH CENTURY: Story of an Air Force potato that&apos;s
left in a rarely used chow hall for over two centuries and wakes up in a world
populated by soybean created imitations under the evil Dick Tater.  Thanks to
him, the soy-potatoes learn that being a &apos;tater is where it&apos;s at.  Memorable
line, &quot;&apos;Cause I&apos;m just a stud spud!&quot;

	FRIDAY THE 13TH DINER SERIES: Crazed potato who was left in a
fryer too long and was charbroiled carelessly returns to wreak havoc on
unsuspecting, would-be teen camp cooks.  Scenes include a girl being stuffed
with chives and Fleischman&apos;s Margarine and a boy served up on a side dish
with beets and dressing.  Definitely not for the squeamish, or those on
diets that are driving them crazy.

	FRIDAY THE 13TH DINER II,III,IV,V,VI: Much, much more of the same.
Except with sour cream.

to the world&apos;s largest french fry (The Dark Powers of Burger King are clearly
behind this).  Most quotable line: &quot;Ah&apos;ll be baked...&quot;

	A FISTFUL OF FRIES: Western in which our hero, The Spud with No Name,
rides into a town that&apos;s deprived of carbohydrates thanks to the evil takeover
of the low-cal Scallopinni Brothers.  Plenty of smokeouts, fry-em-ups, and
general butter-melting by all.

only purpose is the corruption of what the noble did protect.  Whose only
purpose is to destroy.  The noble: who, even when fallen, retain a vestige of

		<string>	So Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark].
With a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to
maneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of
corner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to
flop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward
it, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and --
I can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in
the armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.
	Many people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and
I were not &quot;many people.&quot;  We were experienced waders, and we kept our
heads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you&apos;re
unarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water
up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the
opposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of
our feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all
the way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers
cartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen
these two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked
into trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.

		<string>	The big problem with pornography is defining it.  You can&apos;t just
say it&apos;s pictures of people naked.  For example, you have these
primitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,
and they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal
saying goes: &quot;N&apos;wam k&apos;honi soit qui mali,&quot; which means, &quot;If you think
you can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same
time, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of
Northern Mali that you may be interested in.&quot;
	So it&apos;s not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled &quot;The Girls of the California Junior College System
Hunt the Wildebeest Naked,&quot; some people would call it pornography.  But
others would not.  And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.

	There are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at
a famous concert hall while still learning the rudiments of their
instrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian
gentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated
violinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite
unhampered by great musical talent.
	Three years later the boy&apos;s father insisted that he give a public
concert.  &quot;His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.
A cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.&quot;  Although
Enesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau
in Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.
	&quot;Then you must accompany him on the piano,&quot; said the boy&apos;s father,
&quot;and it will be a sell out.&quot;
	Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited
audience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and
asked for someone to turn his pages.
	In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who
volunteered and made his way to the stage.
	The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the
music critic of Le Figaro wrote: &quot;There was a strange concert at the Salle
Gaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played
the piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.
But the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.&quot;

		<string>There are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need

		<string>There are two jazz musicians who are great buddies.  They hang out and play
together for years, virtually inseparable.  Unfortunately, one of them is
struck by a truck and killed.  About a week later his friend wakes up in
the middle of the night with a start because he can feel a presence in the
room.  He calls out, &quot;Who&apos;s there?  Who&apos;s there?  What&apos;s going on?&quot;
	&quot;It&apos;s me -- Bob,&quot; replies a faraway voice.
	Excitedly he sits up in bed.  &quot;Bob!  Bob!  Is that you?  Where are
you?&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; says the voice, &quot;I&apos;m in heaven now.&quot;
	&quot;Heaven!  You&apos;re in heaven!  That&apos;s wonderful!  What&apos;s it like?&quot;
	&quot;It&apos;s great, man.  I gotta tell you, I&apos;m jamming up here every day.

	&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; says his friend. &quot;That sounds fantastic, tell me more,
tell me more!&quot;
	&quot;Let me put it this way,&quot; continues the voice.  &quot;There&apos;s good news
and bad news.  The good news is that these guys are in top form.  I mean
I have *never* heard them sound better.  They are *wailing* up here.&quot;
	&quot;The bad news is that God has this girlfriend that sings...&quot;

		<string>There&apos;s a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to
recognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over -- and to let
go.  It means leaving what&apos;s over without denying its validity or its
past importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief
that every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.
The trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It&apos;s hard to
recognize that life isn&apos;t a holding action, but a process.  It&apos;s hard to
learn that we don&apos;t leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the
dugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences
and the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take
ourselves along -- quite gracefully.

		<string> VII. Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel
      entrances; others cannot.
	This trompe l&apos;oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least
	it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall&apos;s surface to
	trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical
	space.  The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to
	follow into the painting.  This is ultimately a problem of art, not
	of science.
VIII. Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.
	Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives
	might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated, spliced, splayed,

	destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate,
	elongate, snap back, or solidify.
  IX. For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.
	This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies to

	from the natives, who, are friendly, but seem to be hiding something.
	Kirk, Spock, Bones, Yeoman Rand and two red shirt security officers
	beam down to the planet, where the two security officers are promply
	killed by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.
	As something begins to develop between the Captain and Yeoman Rand,
	Scotty, back in orbit, is attacked by a Klingon destroyer and must
	warp out of orbit.  Although badly outgunned, he cripples the Klingon
	and races back to the planet in order to rescue Kirk et. al. who have
	just saved the natives&apos; from an awful fate and, as a reward, been
	given all light bulbs they can carry.  The new bulb is then inserted
	and the Enterprise continues on its five year mission.

		<string>A book is the work of a mind, doing its work in the way that a mind deems

		<string>	 A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling
			  by Mark Twain

	For example, in Year 1 that useless letter &quot;c&quot; would be dropped
to be replased either by &quot;k&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, and likewise &quot;x&quot; would no longer
be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which &quot;c&quot; would be retained
would be the &quot;ch&quot; formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2
might reform &quot;w&quot; spelling, so that &quot;which&quot; and &quot;one&quot; would take the
same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish &quot;y&quot; replasing it with
&quot;i&quot; and Iear 4 might fiks the &quot;g/j&quot; anomali wonse and for all.
	Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear

		<string>Abstract:
	This study examined the incidence of neckwear tightness among a group
of 94 white-collar working men and the effect of a tight business-shirt collar
and tie on the visual performance of 22 male subjects.  Of the white-collar
men measured, 67% were found to be wearing neckwear that was tighter than
their neck circumference.  The visual discrimination of the 22 subjects was
evaluated using a critical flicker frequency (CFF) test.  Results of the CFF
test indicated that tight neckwear significantly decreased the visual
performance of the subjects and that visual performance did not improve
immediately when tight neckwear was removed.

		<string>=============== ALL FRESHMEN PLEASE NOTE ===============

To minimize scheduling confusion, please realize that if you are taking one
course which is offered at only one time on a given day, and another which is
offered at all times on that day, the second class will be arranged as to 
afford maximum inconvenience to the student.  For example, if you happen
to work on campus, you will have 1-2 hours between classes.  If you commute,
there will be a minimum of 6 hours between the two classes.

</string>
		<string>Briefly stated, the findings are that when presented with an array of
data or a sequence of events in which they are instructed to discover
an underlying order, subjects show strong tendencies to perceive order
and causality in random arrays, to perceive a pattern or correlation
which seems a priori intuitively correct even when the actual correlation
in the data is counterintuitive, to jump to conclusions about the correct
hypothesis, to seek and to use only positive or confirmatory evidence, to
construe evidence liberally as confirmatory, to fail to generate or to
assess alternative hypotheses, and having thus managed to expose themselves
only to confirmatory instances, to be fallaciously confident of the validity
of their judgments (Jahoda, 1969; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1978).  In the
analyzing of past events, these tendencies are exacerbated by failure to
appreciate the pitfalls of post hoc analyses.

		<string>... But if we laugh with derision, we will never understand.  Human
intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as

that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding
of their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard
example of ancient nonsense -- the debate about angels on pinheads --
makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing
whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a
finite or an infinite number.

	For the purpose of answering examinations in your home economics
class, your teacher is correct.  Catching on to this principle of
education may be of even greater importance to you now than learning
correct current table manners, vital as Miss Manners believes that is.

		<string>If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get
the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.  See in
college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural
method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall
learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should
be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the
young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.
I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not
by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise
instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the
attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools,
not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to
put on a professor.

		<string>	In a forest a fox bumps into a little rabbit, and says, &quot;Hi,
Junior, what are you up to?&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m writing a dissertation on how rabbits eat foxes,&quot; said the
rabbit.
	&quot;Come now, friend rabbit, you know that&apos;s impossible!  No one
will publish such rubbish!&quot;
	&quot;Well, follow me and I&apos;ll show you.&quot;
	They both go into the rabbit&apos;s dwelling and after a while the
rabbit emerges with a satisfied expression on his face.  Comes along a
wolf.  &quot;Hello, little buddy, what are we doing these days?&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m writing the 2&apos;nd chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits devour
wolves.&quot;
	&quot;Are you crazy?  Where&apos;s your academic honesty?&quot;
	&quot;Come with me and I&apos;ll show you.&quot;
	As before, the rabbit comes out with a satisfied look on his face
and a diploma in his paw.  Finally, the camera pans into the rabbit&apos;s cave
and, as everybody should have guessed by now, we see a mean-looking, huge
lion, sitting, picking his teeth and belching, next to some furry, bloody
remnants of the wolf and the fox.

	The moral: It&apos;s not the contents of your thesis that are
important -- it&apos;s your PhD advisor that really counts.

		<string>It has long been an article of our folklore that too much knowledge or skill,
or especially consummate expertise, is a bad thing.  It dehumanizes those who
achieve it, and makes difficult their commerce with just plain folks, in whom
good old common sense has not been obliterated by mere book learning or fancy
notions.  This popular delusion flourishes now more than ever, for we are all
infected with it in the schools, where educationists have elevated it from
folklore to Article of Belief.  It enhances their self-esteem and lightens
their labors by providing theoretical justification for deciding that
appreciation, or even simple awareness, is more to be prized than knowledge,
and relating (to self and others), more than skill, in which minimum
competence will be quite enough.

		<string>	It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and

which we can perform without thinking about them.  Operations of thought are
like cavalry charges in battle -- they are strictly limited in number, they
require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.

you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your
honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for
it then -- to learn.  Learn why the world wags and what wags it.  That is
the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be
tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.  Learning
is the only thing for you.  Look what a lot of things there are to learn.&quot;

		<string>cerebral atrophy, n:
	The phenomena which occurs as brain cells become weak and sick, and
impair the brain&apos;s performance.  An abundance of these &quot;bad&quot; cells can cause
symptoms related to senility, apathy, depression, and overall poor academic
performance.  A certain small number of brain cells will deteriorate due to
everday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental effort
and the assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students become
victims of this dread disorder due to poor habits such as overstudying.

cerebral darwinism, n:
	The theory that the effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversed
through the purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts of
alcohol cause many brain cells to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through
the process of natural selection, the weak and sick brain cells will die
first, leaving only the healthy cells.  This wonderful process leaves the
imbiber with a healthier, more vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.
Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academic
performance actually increases beyond previous levels.

The witless mapping of the sublime onto the ridiculous!  Equally puzzling is
the curtation that produces the same eight characters, THE BEST, whether you
order &quot;The Best of Wagner&quot;, &quot;The Best of Schubert&quot;, or &quot;The Best of the Turds&quot;.
Similarly, wine lovers buying from computerized wineries twirl their glasses,
check their delivery notes, and inform their friends, &quot;A rather innocent,

of the engram was a topic of intense speculation among neuroscientists,
psychologists, and even computer scientists.  In 1994 Professors M. R. Wilson
and W. V. Magruder, both of Mount St. Coax University in Palo Alto, proved
conclusively that the mammalian brain is hardwired to interpret a set of
thirty seven genetically transmitted cooperating TECO macros.  Human memory
was shown to reside in 1 million Q-registers as Huffman coded uppercase-only
ASCII strings.  Interest in the engram has declined substantially since that
time.]

		<string>Etymology, n.:
	Some early etymological scholars came up with derivations that

	(&quot;study of&quot;).  It meant &quot;the study of things that are hard to swallow.&quot;

		<string>Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):

Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs.  Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a horse
of another color, and by the lemma [&quot;All horses are the same color&quot;],
that does not exist.

		<string>Fortune&apos;s Rules for Memo Wars: #2

Given the incredible advances in sociocybernetics and telepsychology over
the last few years, we are now able to completely understand everything that
the author of an memo is trying to say.  Thanks to modern developments
in electrocommunications like notes, vnews, and electricity, we have an
incredible level of interunderstanding the likes of which civilization has
never known.  Thus, the possibility of your misinterpreting someone else&apos;s
memo is practically nil.  Knowing this, anyone who accuses you of having
done so is a liar, and should be treated accordingly.  If you *do* understand
the memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then
you have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,
the only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:

	1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.
	2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.
	3: When replying to one of your own memos.

		<string>Frobnicate, v.:
	To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ. Usually
abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying &quot;to frob a frob.&quot; See TWEAK
and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along
a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross
manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes
fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he&apos;s
carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it
but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he&apos;s just
doing it because turning a knob is fun, he&apos;s frobbing it.
</string>
		<string>Frobnitz, pl. Frobnitzem (frob&apos;nitsm) n.:
	An unspecified physical object, a widget.  Also refers to electronic

Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBBOZ (fruh-bahz&apos;), pl. FROBBOTZIM, has also
become very popular, largely due to its exposure via the Adventure spin-off
called Zork (Dungeon).  These can also be applied to non-physical objects,
such as data structures.

		<string>Lemma:  All horses are the same color.
Proof (by induction):
	Case n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all
	horses in that set are the same color.
	Case n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these
	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all
	of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you
	took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k
	horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses
	are all the same color.  We have k true =&gt; k+1 true; therefore all
	horses are the same color.
Theorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.
Proof (by intimidation):
	Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It
	is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in
	back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a
	horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is
	infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.
	However, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an
	infinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different
	color; and by the Lemma, it doesn&apos;t exist.

		<string>MAFIA, n:
	[Acronym for Mechanized Applications in Forced Insurance
Accounting.] An extensive network with many on-line and offshore
subsystems running under OS, DOS, and IOS.  MAFIA documentation is
rather scanty, and the MAFIA sales office exhibits that testy
reluctance to bona fide inquiries which is the hallmark of so many DP
operations.  From the little that has seeped out, it would appear that
MAFIA operates under a non-standard protocol, OMERTA, a tight-lipped
variant of SNA, in which extended handshakes also perform complex
security functions.  The known timesharing aspects of MAFIA point to a
more than usually autocratic operating system.  Screen prompts carry an
imperative, nonrefusable weighting (most menus offer simple YES/YES
options, defaulting to YES) that precludes indifference or delay.
Uniquely, all editing under MAFIA is performed centrally, using a
powerful rubout feature capable of erasing files, filors, filees, and
entire nodal aggravations.

		<string>Rules for Writers:
	Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.  Don&apos;t use no double
negatives.  Use the semicolon properly, always use it where it is appropriate;
and never where it isn&apos;t.  Reserve the apostrophe for it&apos;s proper use and
omit it when its not needed.  No sentence fragments. Avoid commas, that are
unnecessary.  Eschew dialect, irregardless.  And don&apos;t start a sentence with
a conjunction.  Hyphenate between sy-llables and avoid un-necessary hyphens.
Write all adverbial forms correct.  Don&apos;t use contractions in formal writing.
Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.  It is incumbent on
us to avoid archaisms.  Steer clear of incorrect forms of verbs that have
snuck in the language.  Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.  If I&apos;ve
told you once, I&apos;ve told you a thousand times, resist hyperbole.  Also,
avoid awkward or affected alliteration.  Don&apos;t string too many prepositional
phrases together unless you are walking through the valley of the shadow of
death.  &quot;Avoid overuse of &apos;quotation &quot;marks.&quot;&apos;&quot;

		<string>Theorem: All positive integers are equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N &gt; 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
	So A = B.

Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

		<string>		William Safire&apos;s Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never be
used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to agree with
their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be
avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don&apos;t start a sentence with a conjunction.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.) Don&apos;t overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,
dangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of
a sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be
careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.
Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.  Last
but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable alternatives.

		<string>A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head.  The
green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that
grew in the ears themselvse, stuck out on either side like turn signals
indicating two directions at once.  Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the
bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled
with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.  In the shadow under the green visor
of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly&apos;s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down
upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department
store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.  Several
of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be
properly considered offenses against taste and decency.  Possession of
anything new or expensive only reflected a person&apos;s lack of theology and
geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one&apos;s soul.

whispers through his sun-parched lips, &quot;Water... please... can you give...
water...&quot;

with me.  But I&apos;d be delighted to sell you a necktie.&quot;

	&quot;I need *water*.&quot;
	&quot;Okay, okay, say two for seven dollars.&quot;
	&quot;Please!  I need *water*!&quot;, says the man.
	&quot;I don&apos;t have any water, all I have are ties,&quot; replies the salesman,

to stop at one of the rattlesnake farms along the road.  After seeing the 
sights, they engaged in small talk with the man that handled the snakes.
&quot;Gosh!&quot; exclaimed the new bride.  &quot;You certainly have a dangerous job.
Don&apos;t you ever get bitten by the snakes?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, upon rare occasions,&quot; answered the handler.
	&quot;Well,&quot; she continued, &quot;just what do you do when you&apos;re bitten by
a snake?&quot;
	&quot;I always carry a razor-sharp knife in my pocket, and as soon as I
am bitten, I make deep criss-cross marks across the fang entry and then
suck the poison from the wound.&quot;
	&quot;What, uh... what would happen if you were to accidentally *sit* on
a rattler?&quot; persisted the woman.

a Rolex watch, because it weighs nearly six pounds and is advertised
only in excellence-oriented publications such as Fortune and Rich

incomplete sentences, which is how advertising copywriters denote excellence:

&quot;The Rolex Hyperion.  An elegant new standard in quality excellence and
discriminating handcraftsmanship.  For the individual who is truly able
to discriminate with regard to excellent quality standards of crafting
things by hand.  Fabricated of 100 percent 24-karat gold.  No watch parts
or anything.  Just a great big chunk on your wrist.  Truly a timeless
statement.  For the individual who is very secure.  Who doesn&apos;t need to
be reminded all the time that he is very successful. Much more successful
than the people who laughed at him in high school.  Because of his acne.
People who are probably nowhere near as successful as he is now.  Maybe

to them -- it is outrageous to have some outer authority tell you what is
proper use and abuse of your own faculties, and it is ludicrous to hold
reason higher than body or feeling.  Still there is something true and
profoundly sane about the belief that acts like murder or theft or
assault violate the doer as well as the done to.  We might even, if we
thought this way, have less crime.  The popular view of crime, as far as
I can deduce it from the movies and television, is that it is a breaking
of a rule by someone who thinks they can get away with that; implicitly,
everyone would like to break the rule, but not everyone is arrogant
enough to imagine they can get away with it.  It therefore becomes very
important for the rule upholders to bring such arrogance down.

	&quot;Pathetic,&quot; he said.  &quot;That&apos;s what it is.  Pathetic.&quot;

splashed across it, and walked slowly back on the other side.  Then he
looked at himself again.

the bus; it leaves earlier than it used to.
	It seems to me they are making the stairs steeper than in the old
days.  And have you noticed the smaller print they use in the newspapers?
	There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as everbody
speaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them.
	The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the hips
and waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one&apos;s shoelaces.  And the
sizes don&apos;t run the way they used to.  The 12&apos;s and 14&apos;s are so much smaller.
	Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used to
be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much older
than I am.
	I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so much
that she didn&apos;t recognize me.
	I got to thinking about the poor dear while I was combing my hair

		<string>Every man is apt to form his notions of things difficult to be apprehended,
or less familiar, from their analogy to things which are more familiar.
Thus, if a man bred to the seafaring life, and accustomed to think and talk
only of matters relating to navigation, enters into discourse upon any other
subject; it is well known, that the language and the notions proper to his
own profession are infused into every subject, and all things are measured
by the rules of navigation: and if he should take it into his head to
philosophize concerning the faculties of the mind, it cannot be doubted,
but he would draw his notions from the fabric of the ship, and would find
in the mind, sails, masts, rudder, and compass.

		<string>	&quot;I don&apos;t know what you mean by &apos;glory&apos;,&quot; Alice said.
	Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously.  &quot;Of course you don&apos;t --
till I tell you.  I meant &apos;there&apos;s a nice knock-down argument for you!&apos;&quot;
	&quot;But glory doesn&apos;t mean &apos;a nice knock-down argument&apos;,&quot; Alice
objected.
	&quot;When I use a word,&quot; Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful
tone, &quot;it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.&quot;
	&quot;The question is,&quot; said Alice, &quot;whether you can make words mean
so many different things.&quot;
	&quot;The question is,&quot; said Humpty Dumpty, &quot;which is to be master --
that&apos;s all.&quot;

		<string>I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his

		-- Schulz
</string>
		<string>	I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments
of others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, such
as &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I conceive&quot;,
&quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it appears to me
at present&quot;.
	When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him
immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by
observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,
but in the present case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.
	I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the
conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I
proposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.
I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

</string>
		<string>I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of
tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for:  If
they think you&apos;re crude, go technical; if they think you&apos;re technical, go
crude.  I&apos;m a very technical boy.  So I decided to get as crude as possible.
These days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even
aspire to crudeness.

		<string>Largest Number of Driving Test Failures
	By April 1970 Mrs. Miriam Hargrave had failed her test thirty-nine
times.  In the eight preceding years she had received two hundred and
twelve driving lessons at a cost of L300.  She set the new record while
driving triumphantly through a set of red traffic lights in Wakefield,
Yorkshire.  Disappointingly, she passed at the fortieth attempt (3 August
1970) but eight years later she showed some of her old magic when she was
reported as saying that she still didn&apos;t like doing right-hand turns.

		<string>	Looking for a cool one after a long, dusty ride, the drifter strode
into the saloon.  As he made his way through the crowd to the bar, a man
galloped through town screaming, &quot;Big Mike&apos;s comin&apos;!  Run fer yer lives!&quot;
	Suddenly, the saloon doors burst open.  An enormous man, standing over
eight feet tall and weighing an easy 400 pounds, rode in on a bull, using a
rattlesnake for a whip.  Grabbing the drifter by the arm and throwing him over
the bar, the giant thundered, &quot;Gimme a drink!&quot;
	The terrified man handed over a bottle of whiskey, which the man
guzzled in one gulp and then smashed on the bar.  He then stood aghast as
the man stuffed the broken bottle in his mouth, munched broken glass and
smacked his lips with relish.
	&quot;Can I, ah, uh, get you another, sir?&quot; the drifter stammered.
	&quot;Naw, I gotta git outa here, boy,&quot; the man grunted.  &quot;Big Mike&apos;s

		<string>Many mental processes admit of being roughly measured.  For instance,
the degree to which people are bored, by counting the number of their
fidgets. I not infrequently tried this method at the meetings of the
Royal Geographical Society, for even there dull memoirs are occasionally
read.  [...]  The use of a watch attracts attention, so I reckon time
by the number of my breathings, of which there are 15 in a minute.  They
are not counted mentally, but are punctuated by pressing with 15 fingers
successively.  The counting is reserved for the fidgets.  These observations
should be confined to persons of middle age.  Children are rarely still,
while elderly philosophers will sometimes remain rigid for minutes altogether.

Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn&apos;t
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn&apos;t
understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was
reknowned for being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the
time, which obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be
puzzled rather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

only similarity to snowflakes resides in their invariable and lamentable
tendency to turn, after a few warm days, to slush.

		<string>	&quot;Richard, in being so fierce toward my vampire, you were doing
what you wanted to do, even though you thought it was going to hurt
somebody else. He even told you he&apos;d be hurt if...&quot;
	&quot;He was going to suck my blood!&quot;
	&quot;Which is what we do to anyone when we tell them we&apos;ll be hurt
if they don&apos;t live our way.&quot;
...
	&quot;The thing that puzzles you,&quot; he said, &quot;is an accepted saying that
happens to be impossible.  The phrase is hurt somebody else.  We choose,
ourselves, to be hurt or not to be hurt, no matter what.  Us who decides.
Nobody else.  My vampire told you he&apos;d be hurt if you didn&apos;t let him?  That&apos;s
his decision to be hurt, that&apos;s his choice.  What you do about it is your
decision, your choice: give him blood; ignore him; tie him up; drive a stake
through his heart.  If he doesn&apos;t want the holly stake, he&apos;s free to resist,
in whatever way he wants.  It goes on and on, choices, choices.&quot;
	&quot;When you look at it that way...&quot;

	something larger.  Like ... Wyoming.
 4 (personal): Well, here we are.  Just the three of us.
 5 (punctual): Alright gentlemen.  Your nose was on time but you were fifteen

 8 (philosophical): You know.  It&apos;s not the size of a nose that&apos;s important.

16 (obscure): Oh, I&apos;d hate to see the grindstone.
17 (inquiry): When you stop to smell the flowers, are they afraid?
18 (french): Say, the pigs have refused to find any more truffles until you
	leave.
19 (pornographic): Finally, a man who can satisfy two women at once.
20 (religious): The Lord giveth and He just kept on giving, didn&apos;t He.
21 (disgusting): Say, who mows your nose hair?
22 (paranoid): Keep that guy away from my cocaine!
23 (aromatic): It must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and smell the

challenging us to be true to ourselves by appeals to the martial spirit that

		<string>The strong individual loves the earth so much he lusts for recurrence.  He
can smile in the face of the most terrible thought: meaningless, aimless
existence recurring eternally.  The second characteristic of such a man is
that he has the strength to recognise -- and to live with the recognition --
that the world is valueless in itself and that all values are human ones.
He creates himself by fashoning his own values; he has the pride to live
by the values he wills.

		<string>	Then there&apos;s the story of the man who avoided reality for 70 years
with drugs, sex, alcohol, fantasy, TV, movies, records, a hobby, lots of
sleep...  And on his 80th birthday died without ever having faced any of
his real problems.
	The man&apos;s younger brother, who had been facing reality and all his
problems for 50 years with psychiatrists, nervous breakdowns, tics, tension,
headaches, worry, anxiety and ulcers, was so angry at his brother for having
gotten away scott free that he had a paralyzing stroke.

there&apos;s nothing left to do but hit the other person over the head with a

</string>
		<string>What do I consider a reasonable person to be?  I&apos;d say a reasonable person
is one who accepts that we are all human and therefore fallible, and takes
that into account when dealing with others.  Implicit in this definition is
the belief that it is the right and the responsibility of each person to
live his or her own life as he or she sees fit, to respect this right in
others, and to demand the assumption of this responsibility by others.

</string>
		<string>	What is involved in such [close] relationships is a form of emotional
chemistry, so far unexplained by any school of psychiatry I am aware of, that
conditions nothing so simple as a choice between the poles of attraction and
repulsion.  You can meet some people thirty, forty times down the years, and
they remain amiable bystanders, like the shore lights of towns that a sailor
passes at stated times but never calls at on the regular run.  Conversely,
all considerations of sex aside, you can meet some other people once or twice
and they remain permanent influences on your life.
	Everyone is aware of this discrepancy between the acquaintance seen
as familiar wallpaper or instant friend.  The chemical action it entails is
less worth analyzing than enjoying.  At any rate, these six pieces are about
men with whom I felt an immediate sympat - to use a coining of Max Beerbohm&apos;s

mind wonderfully.
		-- Samuel Johnson
</string>
		<string>When a man you like switches from what he said a year ago, or four years

liar who has broken his promises.

		<string>Young men are fitter to invent than to judge; fitter for execution than for
counsel; and fitter for new projects than for settled business.  For the
experience of age, in things that fall within the compass of it, directeth
them; but in new things, abuseth them.  The errors of young men are the ruin
of business; but the errors of aged men amount but to this, that more might
have been done, or sooner.  Young men, in the conduct and management of
actions, embrace more than they can hold; stir more than they can quiet; fly
to the end, without consideration of the means and degrees; pursue some few
principles which they have chanced upon absurdly; care not how they innovate,
which draws unknown inconveniences; and, that which doubleth all errors, will
not acknowledge or retract them; like an unready horse, that will neither stop
nor turn.  Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little,
repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, but
content themselves with a mediocrity of success.  Certainly, it is good to
compound employments of both ... because the virtues of either age may correct
the defects of both.

		<string>Your Co-worker Could Be a Space Alien, Say Experts
		...Here&apos;s How You Can Tell
Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human -- but you
can spot these visitors by looking for certain tip-offs, say experts. They
listed 10 signs to watch for:
    (3) Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don&apos;t understand
	earthly humor may laugh during a company training film or tell
	jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.
    (6) Misuses everyday items.  &quot;A space alien may use correction
	fluid to paint its nails,&quot; said Steiger.
    (8) Secretive about personal life-style and home.  &quot;An alien won&apos;t
	discuss details or talk about what it does at night or on weekends.&quot;
   (10) Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near certain
	high-tech hardware.  &quot;An alien may experience a mood change when
	a microwave oven is turned on,&quot; said Steiger.
The experts pointed out that a co-worker would have to display most if not
all of these traits before you can positively identify him as a space alien.
		-- National Enquirer, Michael Cassels, August, 1984.

		<string>Your conscience never stops you from doing anything.  It just stops you
from enjoying it.
</string>
		<string>Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your
acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.
		-- Richard Bach, &quot;Illusions&quot;
</string>
		<string>Youth -- not a time of life but a state of mind... a predominance of
courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.
		-- Robert F. Kennedy
</string>
		<string>Youth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a regret.
		-- Benjamin Disraeli, &quot;Coningsby&quot;
</string>
		<string>Youth is a disease from which we all recover.
		-- Dorothy Fuldheim
</string>
		<string>	Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind; it is a temper of
the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a predominance
of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease.
	Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years; people grow
old only by deserting their ideals.  Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up
enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.  Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear, and despair
-- these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit
back to dust.
	Whether seventy or sixteen, there is in every being&apos;s heart the love
of wonder, the sweet amazement at the stars and the starlike things and
thoughts, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite
for what next, and the joy and the game of life.
	You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your
self-confidence, as old as your fear, as young as your hope, as old as your
despair.
	So long as your heart receives messages of beauty, cheer, courage,
grandeur and power from the earth, from man, and from the Infinite, so long
you are young.
		-- Samuel Ullman

		<string>When you are in the middle of a story it isn&apos;t a story at all, but
only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered
glass and splintered wood, like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boat
crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard
powerless to stop it.  It&apos;s only afterwards that it becomes anything
like a story at all.  When you are telling it, to yourself or to
someone else.

Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack you, caring nothing for the fact

afraid than is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by

stances being what they were, neither admission could be of any benefit.
Silence, though, could.  It was in the days of the rains that their prayers
went up, not from the fingering of knotted prayer cords or the spinning of
prayer wheels, but from the great pray-machine in the monastery of Ratri,
goddess of the Night.  The high-frequency prayers were directed upward through
the atmosphere and out beyond it, passing into that golden cloud called the
Bridge of the Gods, which circles the entire world, is seen as a bronze
rainbow at night and is the place where the red sun becomes orange at midday.

and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate
earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful
water-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or
diver never went; has slept by many a sailer&apos;s side, where sleepless mothers
would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw&apos;st the locked lovers when
leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting
wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.  Thou saw&apos;st the
murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell
into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed
on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would
have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.  O head! thou has

		<string>The Least Perceptive Literary Critic
	The most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  A
most individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round to
give a public reading of his latest poem.
	Pope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when Lord
Halifax stopped him four or five times and said, &quot;I beg your pardon, Mr.
Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me.&quot;
	Pope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeable
and unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  &quot;Be so good as to mark
the place and consider at your leisure.  I&apos;m sure you can give it a better
turn.&quot;
	After the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.
Garth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  &quot;There is no need to touch the
lines,&quot; he said.  &quot;All you need do is leave them just as they are, call on
Lord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observation
on those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known him
much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event.&quot;
	Pope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poem
exactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none of
their edge.  &quot;Ay&quot;, he commented, &quot;now they are perfectly right.  Nothing can
be better.&quot;

	Betsy Baker played a central role in the history of collecting.  She
was employed as a servant in the house of John Warburton (1682-1759) who had
amassed a fine collection of 58 first edition plays, including most of the
works of Shakespeare.
	One day Warburton returned home to find 55 of them charred beyond
legibility.  Betsy had either burned them or used them as pie bottoms.  The
remaining three folios are now in the British Museum.
	The only comparable literary figure was the maid who in 1835 burned
the manuscript of the first volume of Thomas Carlyle&apos;s &quot;The Hisory of the
French Revolution&quot;, thinking it was wastepaper.

	I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her milk
white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I had punched her
boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told him, &quot;You ride the
bull, senor.  You do not fight it.&quot;  But he was lean and tough like a bad
rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought me.  And when we finished
there were no winners, just men doing what men must do. [...]
	&quot;Stop the car,&quot; the girl said.
	There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about the
woman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to speak, but she raised an
arm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will never forget.

		<string>Well, anyway, I was reading this James Bond book, and right away I realized
that like most books, it had too many words.  The plot was the same one that
all James Bond books have: An evil person tries to blow up the world, but
James Bond kills him and his henchmen and makes love to several attractive
women.  There, that&apos;s it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took
*thousands* of words to say it.
	Or consider &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, by the famous Russian alcoholic
Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  It&apos;s about these two brothers who kill their father.
Or maybe only one of them kills the father.  It&apos;s impossible to tell because
what they mostly do is talk for nearly a thousand pages.  If all Russians talk
as much as the Karamazovs did, I don&apos;t see how they found time to become a
major world power.
	I&apos;m told that Dostoyevsky wrote &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; to raise
the question of whether there is a God.  So why didn&apos;t he just come right
out and say: &quot;Is there a God? It sure beats the heck out of me.&quot;

a lot of other things, so that he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his

his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect
order.  It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and

		<string>&quot;Good afternoon, madam.  How may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon.  I&apos;d like a FrintArms HandCannon, please.&quot;

mean, not everybody thinks ladies should carry guns at all, though I
say they have a right to.  But I think... I might... Let&apos;s have a look
down here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!
Look at that, isn&apos;t it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,
but it&apos;s what&apos;s called a laser -- a light-pistol some people call
them.  Very small, as you see; fits easily into a pocket or bag; won&apos;t
spoil the line of a jacket; and you won&apos;t feel you&apos;re lugging half a
tonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,
including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I
got to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  And
there&apos;s *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,
charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster
with adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your
next battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free
lessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there&apos;s the *special*
presentation pack; it has all the other one&apos;s got but with *two*
charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don&apos;t
worry, it&apos;s a dummy battery -- isn&apos;t it neat?  Feel how light it is?
Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*
beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there&apos;s
no recoil.  Because it&apos;s shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,
beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That&apos;s not a line, she
really has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free
charge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special
offer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for
one-forty-nine.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;ll take the special.&quot;

&quot;Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?&quot;

&quot;And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, three
six-five AP/wire-fl&apos;echettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and a
Special Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embedding
rounds, not the signalers.  I assume the night-sight on this toy is
compatible?&quot;

&quot;Aah... yes,  And how does madam wish to pay?&quot;

		<string>A certain old cat had made his home in the alley behind Gabe&apos;s bar for some
time, subsisting on scraps and occasional handouts from the bartender.  One
evening, emboldened by hunger, the feline attempted to follow Gabe through
the back door.  Regrettably, only the his body had made it through when
the door slammed shut, severing the cat&apos;s tail at its base.  This proved too
much for the old creature, who looked sadly at Gabe and expired on the spot.

The mandatory closing time arrived and Gabe was in the process of locking up
after the last customers had gone.  Approaching the back door he was startled

		<string>[District Attorneys] learn in District Attorney School that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable publicity:

(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    factory puts them there.
(2) Raid an &quot;adult book store&quot; and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A juror at a pornography trial is not about to
    state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
    where actors engage in sexual activities with live snakes and a
    fire extinguisher.  He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and

call: &quot;You won&apos;t believe this, and I&apos;m not drunk, but there&apos;s a wombat in the
phone booth outside the town hall,&quot; the caller said.
	Not firmly convinced about the caller&apos;s claim to sobriety, members of
the constabulary drove to the scene, expecting to pick up a drunk.
	But there it was, an annoyed wombat, trapped in a telephone booth.
	The wombat, determined not to be had the better of again, threw its
bulk into the fray. It was eventually lassoed and released in a nearby scrub.
	Then the officers received another message ... another wombat in
another phone booth.
	There it was: *Another* angry wombat trapped in a telephone booth.
	The constables took the miffed marsupial into temporary custody and
released it, too, in the scrub.
	But on their way back to the station they happened to pass another
telephone booth, and -- you guessed it -- another imprisoned wombat.
	After some serious detective work, the lads in blue found a suspect,
and after questioning, released him to be charged on summons.
	Their problem ... they cannot find a law against placing wombats in
telephone booths.

was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of The Management Group, Inc.
Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connellan attributed a measure of America&apos;s falling productivity to an excess
of attorneys and accountants, and a dearth of production experts.  Lawyers
and accountants &quot;do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure
out how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value
to product.&quot;
	According to Connellan, the highly productive Japanese society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.  The U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests that &quot;the U.S. proportion of

(10) Potholes are

	(a) extremely dangerous.
	(b) patriotic.
	(c) the fault of the previous administration.
	(d) all going to be fixed next summer.

The correct answer is (b). Potholes destroy unpatriotic, unamerican,
imported cars, since the holes are larger than the cars.  If you drive a
big, patriotic, American car you have nothing to worry about.

	    to call the problem to the driver&apos;s attention.
	(b) the driver is signaling a right turn.
	(c) the driver is signaling a left turn.
	(d) the driver is from out of town.

(9) Roads are salted in order to

	(a) kill grass.
	(b) melt snow.
	(c) help the economy.
	(d) prevent potholes.

The correct answer is (c). Road salting employs thousands of persons
directly, and millions more indirectly, for example, salt miners and
rustproofers.  Most important, salting reduces the life spans of cars,
thus stimulating the car and steel industries.

Old Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is
an approximate translation, where I have written &quot;artist&quot; as equivalent of
&quot;lekare&quot;.

		<string>The justifications for drug testing are part of the presently fashionable
debate concerning restoring America&apos;s &quot;competitiveness.&quot; Drugs, it has been
revealed, are responsible for rampant absenteeism, reduced output, and poor
quality work.  But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the
resurrection of competitiveness?  Will charging the atmosphere of the
workplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity?
Much noise has been made about rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but
to date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or the not
hiring of the abuser.  This practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, the
nation&apos;s productivity problem.  If economic rehabilitation is the ultimate
goal of drug testing, then criteria abandoning the rehabilitation of the
drug-using worker is the purest of hypocrisy and the worst of rationalization.

states are better governed by the man in the street than by intellectuals.
These are the sort of people who want to appear wiser than the laws, who
want to get their own way in every general discussion, because they feel that
they cannot show off their intelligence in matters of greater importance, and
who, as a result, very often bring ruin on their country.

Not enough sand.

		<string>When alerted to an intrusion by tinkling glass or otherwise, 1) Calm
yourself 2) Identify the intruder 3) If hostile, kill him.

Step number 3 is of particular importance.  If you leave the guy alive
out of misguided softheartedness, he will repay your generosity of spirit
by suing you for causing his subsequent paraplegia and seek to force you
to support him for the rest of his rotten life.  In court he will plead
that he was depressed because society had failed him, and that he was
looking for Mother Teresa for comfort and to offer his services to the
poor.  In that lawsuit, you will lose.  If, on the other hand, you kill
him, the most that you can expect is that a relative will bring a wrongful
death action. You will have two advantages: first, there be only your
story; forget Mother Teresa.  Second, even if you lose, how much could
the bum&apos;s life be worth anyway?  A Lot less than 50 years worth of
paralysis.  Don&apos;t play George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  Finish the job.

</string>
		<string>	A little dog goes into a saloon in the Wild West, and beckons to
the bartender.  &quot;Hey, bartender, gimme a whiskey.&quot;
	The bartender ignores him.
	&quot;Hey bartender, gimme a whiskey!&quot;
	Still ignored.
	&quot;HEY BARMAN!!  GIMME A WHISKEY!!&quot;
	The bartender takes out his six-shooter and shoots the dog in the
leg, and the dog runs out the saloon, howling in pain.
	Three years later, the wee dog appears again, wearing boots,
jeans, chaps, a Stetson, gun belt, and guns.  He ambles slowly into the
saloon, goes up to the bar, leans over it, and says to the bartender,

		<string>A fellow bought a new car, a Nissan, and was quite happy with his purchase.
He was something of an animist, however, and felt that the car really ought
to have a name.  This presented a problem, as he was not sure if the name
should be masculine or feminine.
	After considerable thought, he settled on an naming the car either
Belchazar or Beaumadine, but remained in a quandry about the final choice.
	&quot;Is a Nissan male or female?&quot; he began asking his friends.  Most of
them looked at him pecularly, mumbled things about urgent appointments, and
went on their way rather quickly.
	He finally broached the question to a lady he knew who held a black
belt in judo.  She thought for a moment and answered &quot;Feminine.&quot;
	The swiftness of her response puzzled him. &quot;You&apos;re sure of that?&quot; he
asked.
	&quot;Certainly,&quot; she replied. &quot;They wouldn&apos;t sell very well if they were
masculine.&quot;
	&quot;Unhhh...  Well, why not?&quot;
	&quot;Because people want a car with a reputation for going when you want
it to.  And, if Nissan&apos;s are female, it&apos;s like they say...  `Each Nissan, she
go!&apos;&quot;

		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

1. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.
	Involvement with the patient&apos;s suffering might cause him to lose
	valuable scientific objectivity.

2. BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.
	Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the
	gentleness and reassurance he can get.

3. TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.
	Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.
</string>
		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

4. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
	You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into
	the true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent
	disability you may have experienced.

5. NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.
	It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be
	explained in terms that you would understand.

6. SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMANTAL TREATMENT READILY.
	Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting
	research paper will surely be of widespread interest.

		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

7. PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.

8. DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
	It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.

9. NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE
   OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
	The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a
	sacred duty to protect him from exposure.

10. NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR&apos;S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.
	This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.

	&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; the doctor replied, &quot;but we don&apos;t know how.  Your son
(we assume) was born with no body.  He only has a head.&quot;
	Well, the doctor was correct.  The Head was alive and well, though no
one knew how.  The Head turned out to be fairly normal, ignoring his lack of
a body, and lived for some time as typical a life as could be expected under
the circumstances.
	One day, about twenty years after the fateful birth, the woman got a
phone call from another doctor.  The doctor said, &quot;I have recently perfected
an operation.  Your son can live a normal life now: we can graft a body onto
his head!&quot;
	The woman, practically weeping with joy, thanked the doctor and hung
up.  She ran up the stairs saying, &quot;Johnny, Johnny, I have a *wonderful*
surprise for you!&quot;
	&quot;Oh no,&quot; cried The Head, &quot;not another HAT!&quot;

judge decided for the plaintiff and awarded him $500,000.
	When he was wheeled into the insurance office to collect his check,
Miller was confronted by several executives.  &quot;You&apos;re not getting away with
this, Miller,&quot; one said.  &quot;We&apos;re going to watch you day and night.  If you
take a single step, you&apos;ll not only repay the damages but stand trial for
perjury.  Here&apos;s the money.  What do you intend to do with it?&quot;

room, over to the man&apos;s bedisde and tells him &quot;Seems like you&apos;re gonna die!&quot;

grabs the intern and screams at him, &quot;What!?!? are you some kind of moron?
You&apos;ve got to take it easy, work your way up to the subject.  Now this man in
213 has about a week to live.  Go in and tell him, but, gently, you hear me,

opens the drapes to let the sun in, walks over to the man&apos;s bedside, fluffs

The Ontopsychological school, availing itself of new research criteria and
of a new telematic epistemology, maintains that social modes do not spring
from dialectics of territory or of class, or of consumer goods, or of means
of power, but rather from dynamic latencies capillarized in millions of
individuals in system functions which, once they have reached the event
maturation, burst forth in catastrophic phenomenology engaging a suitable
stereotype protagonist or duty marionette (general, president, political
party, etc.) to consummate the act of social schizophrenia in mass genocide.

...a report citing a study by Dr. Thomas C. Chalmers, of the Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York, which compared two groups that were being used
to test the theory that ascorbic acid is a cold preventative.  &quot;The group
on placebo who thought they were on ascorbic acid,&quot; says Dr. Chalmers,
&quot;had fewer colds than the group on ascorbic acid who thought they were
on placebo.&quot;
	page 56
The placebo is proof that there is no real separation between mind and body.
Illness is always an interaction between both.  It can begin in the mind and
affect the body, or it can begin in the body and affect the mind, both of
which are served by the same bloodstream.  Attempts to treat most mental
diseases as though they were completely free of physical causes and attempts
to treat most bodily diseases as though the mind were in no way involved must
be considered archaic in the light of new evidence about the way the human
body functions.

		<string>The Vet Who Surprised A Cow
	In the course of his duties in August 1977, a Dutch veterinary
surgeon was required to treat an ailing cow.  To investigate its internal
gases he inserted a tube into that end of the animal not capable of facial
expression and struck a match.  The jet of flame set fire first to some
bales of hay and then to the whole farm causing damage estimate at L45,000. 
The vet was later fined L140 for starting a fire in a manner surprising to
the magistrates.  The cow escaped with shock.

		<string>We have the flu.  I don&apos;t know if this particular strain has an official
name, but if it does, it must be something like &quot;Martian Death Flu&quot;.  You
may have had it yourself.  The main symptom is that you wish you had another
setting on your electric blanket, up past &quot;HIGH&quot;, that said &quot;ELECTROCUTION&quot;.
	Another symptom is that you cease brushing your teeth, because (a)
your teeth hurt, and (b) you lack the strength.  Midway through the brushing
process, you&apos;d have to lie down in front of the sink to rest for a couple
of hours, and rivulets of toothpaste foam would dribble sideways out of your
mouth, eventually hardening into crusty little toothpaste stalagmites that
would bond your head permanently to the bathroom floor, which is how the
police would find you.
	You know the kind of flu I&apos;m talking about.

you go into the auto-suggestion booth and take your regular place on the

	&quot;Thank you, Red.&quot;
	&quot;Now, Evelyn, last week you went up to $40,000 by properly citing
your rivalry with your sibling as a compulsive sado-masochistic behavior
pattern which developed out of an early post-natal feeding problem.&quot;
	&quot;Yes, Red.&quot;
	&quot;But -- later, when asked about pre-adolescent oedipal phantasy
repressions, you rationalized twice and mental blocked three times.  Now,
at $300 per rationalization and $500 per mental block you lost $2,100 off
your $40,000 leaving you with a total of $37,900.  Now, any combination of
two more mental blocks and either one rationalization or three defensive
projections will put you out of the game.  Are you willing to go ahead?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, Red.&quot;
	&quot;I might say here that all of Evelyn&apos;s questions and answers have
been checked for accuracy with her analyst.  Now, Evelyn, for $80,000

To an open keyhole heard, inside,
Two female gossips in converse free --
The subject engaging them was she.
&quot;I think&quot;, said one, &quot;and my husband thinks
That she&apos;s a prying, inquisitive minx!&quot;
As soon as no more of it she could hear
The lady, indignant, removed her ear.

		<string>Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
&quot;What writest thou?&quot;  The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, &quot;The names of those who love the Lord.&quot;
&quot;And is mine one?&quot; said Abou. &quot;Nay not so,&quot;
Replied the angel.  Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, &quot;I pray thee then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.&quot;
The angel wrote, and vanished.  The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo!  Ben Adhem&apos;s name led all the rest.

		<string>After a while you learn the subtle difference
Between holding a hand and chaining a soul,
And you learn that love doesn&apos;t mean security,
And you begin to learn that kisses aren&apos;t contracts
And presents aren&apos;t promises
And you begin to accept your defeats
With your head up and your eyes open,
With the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child,
And you learn to build all your roads
On today because tomorrow&apos;s ground
Is too uncertain.  And futures have
A way of falling down in midflight,
After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much.
So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting
For someone to bring you flowers.
And you learn that you really can endure...
That you really are strong,
And you really do have worth
And you learn and learn
With every goodbye you learn.

He called her by her elvish name;
And there she halted listening.
One moment stood she, and a spell
His voice laid on her: Beren came
And doom fell on Tin&apos;uviel
That in his arms lay glistening.

As Beren looked into her eyes
Within the shadows of her hair,
The trembling starlight of the skies
He saw there mirrored shimmering.
Tin&apos;uviel the elven-fair,
Immortal maiden elven-wise,
About him cast her shadowy hair
And arms like silver glimmering.

Long was the way that fate them bore,
O&apos;er stony mountains cold and grey,
Through halls of iron and darkling door,
And woods of nightshade morrowless.
The Sundering Seas between them lay,
And yet at last they met once more,
And long ago they passed away
In the forest singing sorrowless.

		<string>			Against Idleness and Mischief

How doth the little busy bee		How skillfully she builds her cell!
Improve each shining hour,		How neat she spreads the wax!
And gather honey all the day		And labours hard to store it well
From every opening flower!		With the sweet food she makes.

In works of labour or of skill		In books, or work, or healthful play,
I would be busy too;			Let my first years be passed,
For Satan finds some mischief still	That I may give for every day
For idle hands to do.			Some good account at last.

Who controlled the system; graphics was his sport.

Many a protected file he had sitting on his table.

Clicking and feeping wind as clear,
Aye, and as loud as does the machine room bell
Where my lord Hacker was Prior of the cell.

As old and strict he tended to ignore;
He let go by the things of yesterday
And took the modern world&apos;s more spacious way.
He did not rate that text as a plucked hen
Which says that Hackers are not holy men.
And that a hacker underworked is a mere
Fish out of water, flapping on the pier.
That is to say, a hacker out of his cloister.
That was a text he held not worth an oyster.
And I agreed and said his views were sound;
Was he to study till his head wend round
Poring over books in the cloisters?  Must he toil
As Andy bade and till the very soil?
Was he to leave the world upon the shelf?
Let Andy have his labor to himself!

Of hateful soreness, purge mine ears of corn;
Less dear than army ants in apple pies

Go fly a kite, thy welcome&apos;s overstayed;
And stem the produce of thy waspish wits:
Thy logick, like thy locks, is disarrayed;
Thy cheer, like thy complexion, is the pits.
Be off, I say; go bug somebody new,
Scram, beat it, get thee hence, and nuts to you.

Disapproval would be folly;		Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens;
Deck the halls with hunks of holly;	Even though the prospect sickens,
Fill the cup and don&apos;t say when...	Brother, here we go again.

On Christmas day, you can&apos;t get sore;	Relations sparing no expense&apos;ll,
Your fellow man you must adore;		Send some useless old utensil,
There&apos;s time to rob him all the more,	Or a matching pen and pencil,
The other three hundred and sixty-four!	Just the thing I need... how nice.

It doesn&apos;t matter how sincere		Hark The Herald-Tribune sings,
It is, nor how heartfelt the spirit;	Advertising wondrous things.
Sentiment will not endear it;		God Rest Ye Merry Merchants,
What&apos;s important is... the price.	May you make the Yuletide pay.
					Angels We Have Heard On High,
Let the raucous sleighbells jingle;	Tell us to go out and buy.

For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.
A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents:
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance;
And when not being utilitized to aid in locomotion,
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.

Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,

And he knew his toes could feel it.

And his bootless foot is lasting lame;

With the bone he boned from its owner.

If that&apos;s the sound, someone&apos;s copping a plea,
And, like, old Caesar really set them straight.

So are they all, all cool cats, --

		<string>Gibson&apos;s Springtime Song (to the tune of &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;):

&apos;Tis the season to chase mousies (Fa la la la la, la la la la)
Snatch them from their little housies (...)
First we chase them &apos;round the field (...)
Then we have them for a meal (...)

Toss them here and catch them there (...)
See them flying through the air (...)
Watch them fly and hear them squeal (...)
Falling mice have great appeal (...)

See the hunter stretched before us (...)
He&apos;s chased the mice in field and forest (...)
Watch him clean his long white whiskers (...)
Of the blood of little critters (...)

		<string>Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen,
his shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven&apos;s field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.

		<string>	Hack placidly amidst the noisy printers and remember what prizes there
may be in Science.  As fast as possible get a good terminal on a good system.
Enter your data clearly but always encrypt your results.  And listen to others,
even the dull and ignorant, for they may be your customers.  Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, for they are sales reps.
	If you compare your outputs with those of others, you may be surprised,
for always there will be greater and lesser numbers than you have crunched.
Keep others interested in your career, and try not to fumble; it can be a real
hassle and could change your fortunes in time.
	Exercise system control in your experiments, for the world is full of
bugs.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
for linearity and everywhere papers are full of approximations.  Strive for
proportionality.  Especially, do not faint when it occurs.  Neither be cyclical
about results; for in the face of all data analysis it is sure to be noticed.
	Take with a grain of salt the anomalous data points.  Gracefully pass
them on to the youth at the next desk.  Nurture some mutual funds to shield
you in times of sudden layoffs.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings
-- the real bugs are enough to screw you badly.  Murphy&apos;s Law runs the
Universe -- and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt &lt;Curl&gt;B*n dS = 0.
	Therefore, grab for a piece of the pie, with whatever proposals you
can conceive of to try.  With all the crashed disks, skewed data, and broken
line printers, you can still have a beautiful secretary.  Be linear.  Strive
to stay employed.

		<string>He heard there oft the flying sound
Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
Of music welling underground,
In hidden hollows quavering.
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,
And one by one with sighing sound
Whispering fell the beechen leaves
In the wintry woodland wavering.

He sought her ever, wandering far
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,
By light of moon and ray of star
In frosty heavens shivering.
Her mantle glinted in the moon,
As on a hill-top high and far
She danced, and at her feet was strewn
A mist of silver quivering.

When winter passed, she came again,
And her song released the sudden spring,
Like rising lark, and falling rain,
And melting water bubbling.
He saw the elven-flowers spring
About her feet, and healed again
He longed by her to dance and sing
Upon the grass untroubling.

green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,
the last ere the year&apos;s end to keep them from the winter,
to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted.

Each year at summer&apos;s end I go to find them for her,
in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;
there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.

By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,
fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.
Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!

its users will be content.
They enjoy hacking their code

There may be telnet, rlogin, and ftp,

Here&apos;s an easy game to play.
Here&apos;s an easy thing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, 
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, 
And your data is corrupted &apos;cause the index doesn&apos;t hash, 
then your situation&apos;s hopeless, and your system&apos;s gonna crash!

You can&apos;t say this?  What a shame, sir!
We&apos;ll find you another game, sir.

If the label on the cable on the table at your house,
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, 
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That&apos;s repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
&apos;Cause as sure as I&apos;m a poet, the sucker&apos;s gonna hang!

When the copy of your floppy&apos;s getting sloppy on the disk, 
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc, 
Then you have to flash your memory and you&apos;ll want to ram your rom.
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

When the team got			to me about my blue jacket;
their warm-up jackets			the guys were my friends
I didn&apos;t get one			Yet it hurt me all year
Only the regular team			to wear that blue jacket
got these jackets, and			among all those green ones
surely not a manager			Even now, forty years after,
					I still recall that jacket
					and the memory goes on hurting.

A stately pleasure dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.

With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forest ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

In the new magic land
The Indians and the buffalo    
Existed hand in hand
The Indians needed food
They need skins for a roof

And the buffalo ran loose

With his thick and empty head
He couldn&apos;t see past his billfold
He wanted all the buffalo dead
It was sad, oh so sad.

To whom it may concern,			I held her for so long.
Traveling twice the speed of sound	She finally looked at me in love,
It&apos;s easy to get burned.		And she was gone.

We had to get back home,		A lesson to be learned.
And when we opened up the door		Traveling twice the speed of sound

Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies.

		<string>Ladies and Gentlemen, Hobos and Tramps,
Cross-eyed mosquitos and bowlegged ants,
I come before you to stand behind you
To tell you of something I know nothing about.
Next Thursday (which is good Friday),
There will be a convention held in the
Women&apos;s Club which is strictly for Men.
Admission is free, pay at the door,
Pull up a chair, and sit on the floor.
It was a summer&apos;s day in winter,
And the snow was raining fast,
As a barefoot boy with shoes on,
Stood sitting in the grass.
Oh, that bright day in the dead of night,
Two dead men got up to fight.
Three blind men to see fair play,
Forty mutes to yell &quot;Hooray&quot;!
Back to back, they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot each other.
A deaf policeman heard the noise,
Came and arrested those two dead boys.
</string>
		<string>Ladles and Jellyspoons!
I come before you to stand behind you,
To tell you something I know nothing about.
Since next Thursday will be Good Friday,
There will be a fathers&apos; meeting, for mothers only.
Wear your best clothes, if you don&apos;t have any,
And please stay at home if you can possibly be there.
Admission is free, please pay at the door.
Have a seat on me: please sit on the floor.
No matter where you manage to sit,
The man in the balcony will certainly spit.
We thank you for your unkind attention,
And would now like to present our next act:
&quot;The Four Corners of the Round Table.&quot;
</string>
		<string>Lady, lady, should you meet
One whose ways are all discreet,
One who murmurs that his wife
Is the lodestar of his life,
One who keeps assuring you
That he never was untrue,
Never loved another one...

		<string>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth&apos;s unknown, although his height be taken.
Love&apos;s not Time&apos;s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle&apos;s compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
</string>

Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has bought us.
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

I figured we&apos;d painted too much of this town,
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon,
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found,
I knew then I had lost what should have been found.
	And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
	I&apos;m as low as a paid assassin is
	You know I&apos;m cold as a hired sword.

	You know I can&apos;t think straight no more

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,
And he went down, but to my surprise,
Come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
So I busted a chair right across his teeth,
And we crashed through the walls and into the streets,
Kickin&apos; and a-gougin&apos; in the mud and the blood and beer.
Now I tell you, I&apos;ve fought tougher men,
But I really can&apos;t remember when:
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
But I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
And he went for his gun, but I pulled mine first,
And he sat there lookin&apos; at me, and I saw him smile.
He said: &quot;Son, this world is rough,
And if a man&apos;s gonna make it he&apos;s gotta be tough,
And I knew I wouldn&apos;t be there to help you along.

On the Rue des Ecoles
lived an old man
with a blind dog
Every evening I would see him
guiding the dog along
the sidewalk, keeping
a firm grip on the leash
so that the dog wouldn&apos;t
run into a passerby
Sometimes the dog would stop
and look up at the sky
Once the old man
noticed me watching the dog
and he said, &quot;Oh, yes,
this one knows
when the moon is out,
he can feel it on his face&quot;

Seven megs for the hackers scarce,

		<string>No one likes us.
I don&apos;t know why.
We may not be perfect,			We give them money,
But heaven knows we try.		But are they grateful?
But all around,				No, they&apos;re spiteful,
Even our old friends put us down.	And they&apos;re hateful.
Let&apos;s drop the big one,			They don&apos;t respect us,
And see what happens.			So let&apos;s surprise them
					We&apos;ll drop the big one,
					And pulverize &apos;em.
Asia&apos;s crowded,
Europe&apos;s too old,
Africa is far too hot,			We&apos;ll save Australia.
And Canada&apos;s too cold.			Don&apos;t wanna hurt no kangaroos.
And South America stole our name	We&apos;ll build an All-American amusement
Let&apos;s drop the big one,				park there--
There&apos;ll be no one left to blame us.	They got surfin&apos;, too!

Boom! goes London,
And Boom! Paree.
More room for you,			Oh, how peaceful it&apos;ll be!
And more room for me,			We&apos;ll set everybody free!
And every city,				You&apos;ll wear a Japanese kimono, babe;
The whole world round,			There&apos;ll be Italian shoes for me!
Will just be another American town.	They all hate us anyhow,
					So, let&apos;s drop the big one now.

		<string>No pig should go sky diving during monsoon
For this isn&apos;t really the norm.
But should a fat swine try to soar like a loon,
So what?  Any pork in a storm.

No pig should go sky diving during monsoon,
It&apos;s risky enough when the weather is fine.
But to have a pig soar when the monsoon doth roar
Cast even more perils before swine.

		<string>No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.

Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, &quot;Enough!&quot;

Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff&apos;s job -- he didn&apos;t seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!

What&apos;s one little bug?&quot;

But he was determined,			Then change two, then three more,
The others went home.			As year followed year.
He dug out the flow chart		And strangers would comment,
Deserted, alone.			&quot;Is that guy still here?&quot;

Night passed into morning.		He died at the console
The room was cluttered			Of hunger and thirst
With core dumps, source listings.	Next day he was buried
&quot;I&apos;m close,&quot; he muttered.		Face down, nine edge first.

Chain smoking, cold coffee,		And his wife through her tears
Logic, deduction.			Accepted his fate.

You got nothing -- you got nothing at all...

And reiterate all of our thoughts.	With frequent addenda
					And consider a load of reports.

We compose and propose,
We suppose and oppose,			But though various notions
And the points of procedure are fun;	Are brought up as motions,
					There&apos;s terribly little gets done.

We resolve and absolve;
But we never dissolve,
Since it&apos;s out of the question for us
To bring our committee
To end like this ditty,
Which stops with a period, thus.

Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town?

Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks;
And now you&apos;ve gay bracelets and bright feathers three!&quot;
&quot;Yes: That&apos;s how we dress when we&apos;re ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;At home in the barton you said `thee&apos; and `thou,&apos;
And `thik oon&apos; and `theas oon&apos; and `t&apos;other;&apos; but now
Your talking quite fits &apos;ee for compa-ny!&quot;
&quot;Some polish is gained with one&apos;s ruin,&quot; said she.

&quot;Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak
But now I&apos;m bewitched by your delicate cheek,
And your little gloves fit like as on any la-dy!&quot;
&quot;We never do work when we&apos;re ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
And you&apos;d sigh, and you&apos;d sock; but at present you seem
To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!&quot;
&quot;True.  One&apos;s pretty lively when ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!&quot;

Cannot quite expect that.  You ain&apos;t ruined,&quot; said she.

My eager craft through footless halls of air.
Up, up along delirious, burning blue
I&apos;ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,
Where never lark, or even eagle flew;

The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

		<string>On a morning from a Bogart movie, in a country where they turned back time,
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime.
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain.
Don&apos;t bother asking for explanations, she&apos;ll just tell you that she came
In the Year of the Cat.

She doesn&apos;t give you time for questions, as she locks up your arm in hers,
And you follow &apos;till your sense of which direction completely disappears.
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stall there&apos;s a hidden door she
    leads you to.
These days, she say, I feel my life just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat.

Well, she looks at you so coolly,
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea.
She comes in incense and patchouli,
So you take her to find what&apos;s waiting inside
The Year of the Cat.

Well, morning comes and you&apos;re still with her, but the bus and the tourists
    are gone,
And you&apos;ve thrown away your choice and lost your ticket, so you have to stay on.
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain in the rhythm of the new-born day.
You know some time you&apos;re bound to leave her, but for now you&apos;re going to stay
In the Year of the Cat.

And once as he finished reading from the secretary&apos;s spool,

And this as delivermail did work and he ran his backfstat,

But when they did a ps -ut they found the system crashed!
Oh, the wizards adb&apos;d the dumps and did the system trace,
And worked on the file system &apos;til the disk head was hot paste,
But all they ever found was this:  &quot;panic: never doubt&quot;,
	And the bio bug&apos;ll crash your box too, ef you don&apos;t watch out!
When the day is done and the moon comes out,
And you hear the printer whining and the rk&apos;s seems to count,
When the other desks are empty and their terminals glassy grey,
And the load is only 1.6 and you wonder if it&apos;ll stay,
You must mind the file protections and not snoop around,

Nobody living can ever make me turn back,
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking, I saw a sign there,
And on the sign it said: &quot;No Trespassing.&quot;
But on the other side, it didn&apos;t say nothing,

I wonder how the old folks are tonight,
Her name was Ann, and I&apos;ll be damned if I recall her face,

Carefree Highway, let me slip away on you,
Carefree Highway, you seen better days,
The morning after blues, from my head down to my shoes,
Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away, on you...

Turning back the pages to the times I love best,
I wonder if she&apos;ll ever do the same,
Now the thing that I call livin&apos; is just bein&apos; satisfied,
With knowing I got noone left to blame.
Carefree Highway, I got to see you, my old flame...

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep,
I wonder if the years have closed her mind,
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin&apos; to get free,

		<string>Roland was a warrior, from the land of the midnight sun,
With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done.
The deal was made in Denmark, on a dark and stormy day,
So he set out for Biafra, to join the bloody fray.
Through sixty-six and seven, they fought the Congo war,
With their fingers on their triggers, knee deep in gore.
Days and nights they battled, the Bantu to their knees,
They killed to earn their living, and to help out the Congolese.
	Roland the Thompson gunner...
His comrades fought beside him, Van Owen and the rest,
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best.
So the C.I.A decided, they wanted Roland dead,
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen, blew off Roland&apos;s head.
	Roland the headless Thompson gunner...
Roland searched the continent, for the man who&apos;d done him in.
He found him in Mombasa, in a bar room drinking gin,
Roland aimed his Thompson gun, he didn&apos;t say a word,
But he blew Van Owen&apos;s body from there to Johannesburg.
The eternal Thompson gunner, still wandering through the night,
Now it&apos;s ten years later, but he stills keeps up the fight.
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine, in Berkeley,
Patty Hearst... heard the burst... of Roland&apos;s Thompson gun, and bought it.

On its way towards its end.

For a long while, yet, in the roses,
She will linger on, yearning for peace,
And slowly
Close her weary eyes.

		<string>The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tin&apos;uviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

There Beren came from mountains colds,
And lost he wandered under leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wonder flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.

Enchantment healed his weary feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She lightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.

		<string>The Poet Whose Badness Saved His Life
	The most important poet in the seventeenth century was George
Wither.  Alexander Pope called him &quot;wretched Wither&quot; and Dryden said of his
verse that &quot;if they rhymed and rattled all was well&quot;.
	In our own time, &quot;The Dictionary of National Biography&quot; notes that his
work &quot;is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.  It usually
lacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel&quot;.
	High praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically
rewarding stanza: It is taken from &quot;I loved a lass&quot; and is concerned with
the higher emotions.
		She would me &quot;Honey&quot; call,
		She&apos;d -- O she&apos;d kiss me too.
		But now alas!  She&apos;s left me
		Falero, lero, loo.
	Among other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize
was her prudent choice of footwear.
		The fives did fit her shoe.
	In 1639 the great poet&apos;s life was endangered after his capture by
the Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the
Royalist poet, heard of Wither&apos;s imminent execution, he went to the King and
begged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,
&quot;Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the
worst poet in England.&quot;

		<string>The Worst American Poet
	Julia Moore, &quot;the Sweet Singer of Michigan&quot; (1847-1920) was so bad that
Mark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.
	Her verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire
of Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her pen.
	Whether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the
formula was the same:
		Have you heard of the dreadful fate
		Of Mr. P.P. Bliss and wife?
		Of their death I will relate,
		And also others lost their life
		(in the) Ashbula Bridge disaster,
		Where so many people died.
	Even if you started out reasonably healthy in one of Julia&apos;s poems,
the chances are that after a few stanzas you would be at the bottom of a
river or struck by lightning.  A critic of the day said she was &quot;worse than
a Gatling gun&quot; and in one slim volume counted 21 killed and 9 wounded.
	Incredibly, some newspapers were critical of her work, even
suggesting that the sweet singer was &quot;semi-literate&quot;.  Her reply was
forthright: &quot;The Editors that has spoken in this scandalous manner have went
beyond reason.&quot;  She added that &quot;literary work is very difficult to do&quot;.

		<string>		The Worst Lines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger&apos;s promising line:
	&quot;Come, muse, let us sing of rats.&quot;
Grainger (1721-67) did not have the courage of his convictions and deleted
these words on discovering that his listeners dissolved into spontaneous
laughter the instant they were read out.
	No such reluctance afflicted Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) who was
inspired by the subject of war.
	&quot;Flash! flash! bang! bang! and we blazed away,
	And the grey roof reddened and rang;
	Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay
	The tip of my ear.  Flash! bang!&quot;
By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):
	&quot;... that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste of solid milk...&quot;
While John Bidlake was guided by a compassion for vegetables:
	&quot;The sluggard carrot sleeps his day in bed,
	The crippled pea alone that cannot stand.&quot;
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:
	&quot;And I was ask&apos;d and authorized to go
	To seek the firm of Clutterbuck and Co.&quot;
William Balmford explored the possibilities of religious verse:
	&quot;So &apos;tis with Christians, Nature being weak
	While in this world, are liable to leak.&quot;
And William Wordsworth showed that he could do it if he really tried when
describing a pond:
	&quot;I&apos;ve measured it from side to side;
	Tis three feet long and two feet wide.&quot;

In my life I&apos;ve loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compared with you,
All these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I&apos;ll never lose affection

In my life I&apos;ll love you more.

		<string>There&apos;s amnesia in a hangknot,
And comfort in the ax,
But the simple way of poison will make your nerves relax.
	There&apos;s surcease in a gunshot,
	And sleep that comes from racks,

You find rest on the hot squat,
Or gas can give you pax,
But the closest corner chemist has peace in packaged stacks.
	There&apos;s refuge in the church lot
	When you tire of facing facts,
	And the smoothest route is poison prescribed by kindly quacks.
Chorus:	With an *ugh!* and a groan, and a kick of the heels,

For art is a form of catharsis,

So I&apos;m thinking of throwing the battle --

Whose sex is very hard to see

There are so many sons of bees.

		<string>Those who sweat in flames of hell,	Leaden eared, some thought their bowels
Here&apos;s the reason that they fell:	Lispeth forth the sweetest vowels.
While on earth they prayed in SAS,	These they offered up in praise
PL/1, or other crass,			Thinking all this fetid haze
Vulgar tongue.				A rapsody sung.

Some the lord did sorely try		Jabber of the mindless horde
Assembling all their pleas in hex.	Sequel next did mock the lord
Speech as crabbed as devil&apos;s crable	Slothful sequel so enfangled
Hex that marked on Tower Babel		Its speaker&apos;s lips became entangled
The highest rung.			In his bung.

Because in life they prayed so ill
And offered god such swinish swill
Now they sweat in flames of hell
Sweat from lack of APL
Sweat dung!

		<string>Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine		And then one day you find
Staying home to watch the rain		Ten years have got behind you
You are young and life is long		No one told you when to run
And there is time to kill today		You missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it&apos;s sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you&apos;re older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter		Hanging on in quiet desperation
						is the English way
Never seem to find the time		The time is gone, the song is over
Plans that either come to nought	Thought I&apos;d something more to say...
Or half a page of scribbled lines

		<string>To write a sonnet you must ruthlessly
strip down your words to naked, willing flesh.
Then bind them to a metaphor or three,
and take by force a satisfying mesh.
Arrange them to your will, each foot in place.
You are the master here, and they the slaves.
Now whip them to maintain a constant pace
and rhythm as they stand in even staves.
A word that strikes no pleasure?  Cast it out!
What use are words that drive not to the heart?
A lazy phrase? Discard it, shrug off doubt,
and choose more docile words to take its part.
A well-trained sonnet lives to entertain,
by making love directly to the brain.

		<string>Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,
And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;
For many a year he had gnawed it near,
For meat was hard to come by.
	Done by!  Gum by!
In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,
And meat was hard to come by.

Up came Tom with his big boots on.
Said he to Troll: &quot;Pray, what is youn?
For it looks like the shin o&apos; my nuncle Tim,
As should be a-lyin in graveyard.
	Caveyard!  Paveyard!
This many a year has Tim been gone,
And I thought he were lyin&apos; in graveyard.&quot;

&quot;My lad,&quot; said Troll, &quot;this bone I stole.
But what be bones that lie in a hole?
Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o&apos; lead,
Afore I found his shinbone.
	Tinbone!  Thinbone!
He can spare a share for a poor old troll
For he don&apos;t need his shinbone.&quot;

Said Tom: &quot;I don&apos;t see why the likes o&apos; thee
Without axin&apos; leave should go makin&apos; free
With the shank or the shin o&apos; my father&apos;s kin;
So hand the old bone over!
	Rover!  Trover!
Though dead he be, it belongs to he;
So hand the old bnone over!&quot;

Not a streetcar was in sight,		Except one a tiny tot,
So I stepped into a cigar store		Who had a home across the way
To ask them for a light.		Above a vacant lot.

The man	behind the counter		As I gazed through the oaken door
Was a woman, old and gray,		A whale went drifting by,
Who used to peddle doughnuts		Its six legs hanging in the air,
On the road to Mandalay.		So I kissed her goodbye.

She said &quot;Good morning, stranger&quot;,	This story has a morale
Her eyes were dry with tears,		As you can plainly see,
As she put her head between her feet	Don&apos;t mix your gin with whiskey
And stood that way for years.		On the deep and dark blue sea.

The programmers were wrung out too mindless to care,
	Knowing chances of cutover hadn&apos;t a prayer.

When out in the lobby there arose such a clatter,

And what to my wondering eyes should appear,
	But a Super Programmer, oblivious to fear.
More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
	And he whistled and shouted and called them by name;
On Update!  On Add!  On Inquiry!  On Delete!
	On Batch Jobs!  On Closing!  On Functions Complete!
His eyes were glazed over, his fingers were lean,
	From Weekends and nights in front of a screen.

We&apos;re so glad you could attend, come inside, come inside!
There behind the glass there&apos;s a real blade of grass,
Be careful as you pass, move along, move along.
Come inside, the show&apos;s about to start,
Guaranteed to blow your head apart.
Rest assured, you&apos;ll get your money&apos;s worth,
Greatest show, in heaven, hell or earth!
You gotta see the show!  It&apos;s a dynamo!
You gotta see the show!  It&apos;s rock &apos;n&apos; roll!

		<string>Well I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five,
The headline screamed that I was still alive,
I couldn&apos;t understand it, I thought I died last night.
I dreamed I&apos;d been in a border town,
In a little cantina that the boys had found,
I was desperate to dance, just to dig the local sounds.
When along came a senorita,
She looked so good that I had to meet her,
I was ready to approach her with my English charm,
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm,
And he said, grow some funk of your own, amigo,
Grow some funk of your own.
We no like to with the gringo fight,
But there might be a death in Mexico tonite.
...
Take my advice, take the next flight,
And grow some funk, grow your funk at home.

		<string>Well, fancy giving money to the Government!
Might as well have put it down the drain.
Fancy giving money to the Government!
Nobody will see the stuff again.
Well, they&apos;ve no idea what money&apos;s for --
Ten to one they&apos;ll start another war.
I&apos;ve heard a lot of silly things, but, Lor&apos;!
Fancy giving money to the Government!

		<string>Well, I don&apos;t know where they come from but they sure do come,
I hope they comin&apos; for me!
And I don&apos;t know how they do it but they sure do it good,
I hope they doin&apos; it for free!
They give me cat scratch fever... cat scratch fever!
First time that I got it I was just ten years old,
Got it from the kitty next door...
I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure,
I think I got it some more!
Got a bad scratch fever...

		<string>Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
And he didn&apos;t leave much for Ma and me,
Just and old guitar an&apos;a empty bottle of booze.
Now I don&apos;t blame him &apos;cause he ran and hid,
But the meanest thing that he ever did,
Was before he left he went and named me Sue.
...
But I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I&apos;d search the honkey tonks and the bars,
And kill the man that give me that awful name.
It was Gatlinburg in mid-July,
I&apos;d just hit town and my throat was dry,
Thought I&apos;d stop and have myself a brew,
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
Sitting at a table, dealing stud,
Sat that dirty (bleep) that named me Sue.
...
Now, I knew that snake was my own sweet Dad,
From a wornout picture that my Mother had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye...

		<string>Well, my terminal&apos;s locked up, and I ain&apos;t got any Mail,
	And I can&apos;t recall the last time that my program didn&apos;t fail;
I&apos;ve got stacks in my structs, I&apos;ve got arrays in my queues,
	I&apos;ve got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

If you think that it&apos;s nice that you get what you C,
	Then go : illogical statement with your whole family,
&apos;Cause the Supreme Court ain&apos;t the only place with : Bus error views.
	I&apos;ve got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

On a PDP-11, life should be a breeze,
	But with VAXen in the house even magnetic tapes would freeze.
Now you might think that unlike VAXen I&apos;d know who I abuse,
	I&apos;ve got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early.

		<string>Well, we&apos;re big rock singers, we&apos;ve got golden fingers,
And we&apos;re loved everywhere we go.
We sing about beauty, and we sing about truth,
At ten thousand dollars a show.
We take all kind of pills to give us all kind of thrills,
But the thrill we&apos;ve never known,
Is the thrill that&apos;ll get&apos;cha, when you get your picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.

I got a freaky old lady, name of Cole King Katie,
Who embroiders on my jeans.
I got my poor old gray-haired daddy,
Drivin&apos; my limousine.
Now it&apos;s all designed, to blow our minds,
But our minds won&apos;t be really be blown;
Like the blow that&apos;ll get&apos;cha, when you get your picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.

We got a lot of little, teen-aged, blue-eyed groupies,
Who&apos;ll do anything we say.
We got a genuine Indian guru, that&apos;s teachin&apos; us a better way.
We got all the friends that money can buy,
So we never have to be alone.
And we keep gettin&apos; richer, but we can&apos;t get our picture,
On the cover of the Rolling Stone.

		<string>What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
Like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore --

Maybe it just sags
Like a heavy load.
  
Or does it explode?

					Dump, dump it and type it out,
					The file, the highseg of login.
Why lies it here, on public disk
And why is it now unprotected?

And copy the file somehow, somehow.	The problem has not been corrected.

Our Standardized Model should please even you,
Tho&apos; once you did say that of charm there was none
It took courage to switch as to say Earth moves not Sun.
Yet your state of the union penultimate large
Is the last known haunt of the Fractional Charge,
And as you surf in the hot tub with sourdough roll
Please ponder the passing of your sole Monopole.
Your Olympics were fun, you should bring them all back
For transsexual tennis or Anamalon Track,
But Hollywood movies remain sinfully crude
Whether seen on the telly or Remotely Viewed.
Now fasten your sunbelts, for you&apos;ve done it once more,
You said it in Leipzig of the thing we adore,
That you&apos;ve built an incredible crystalline sphere
Whose German attendants spread trembling and fear
Of the death of our theory by Particle Zeta
Which I&apos;ll bet is not there say your article, later.

Like enough, you won&apos;t be glad,
When they come to hang you, lad:
But bacon&apos;s not the only thing
That&apos;s cured by hanging from a string.
So, when the spilt ink of the night
Spreads o&apos;er the blotting pad of light,
Lads whose job is still to do
Shall whet their knives, and think of you.

		<string>When I think about myself,
I almost laugh myself to death,
My life has been one great big joke,	Sixty years in these folks&apos; world
A dance that&apos;s walked			The child I works for calls me girl
A song that&apos;s spoke,			I say &quot;Yes ma&apos;am&quot; for working&apos;s sake.
I laugh so hard I almost choke		Too proud to bend
When I think about myself.		Too poor to break,
					I laugh until my stomach ache,
					When I think about myself.
My folks can make me split my side,
I laughed so hard I nearly died,
The tales they tell, sound just like lying,
They grow the fruit, 
But eat the rind,
I laugh until I start to crying,
When I think about my folks.

And if I shiver please give me a blanket,
Keep me warm let me wear your coat

For might makes right,			Members of the corps
And till they&apos;ve seen the light,	All hate the thought of war:
They&apos;ve got to be protected,		They&apos;d rather kill them off by
						peaceful means.
All their rights respected,		Stop calling it aggression--
Till somebody we like can be elected.	We hate that expression!
					We only want the world to know
					That we support the status quo;
					They love us everywhere we go,
					So when in doubt, send the Marines!

		<string>When the Guru administers, the users 
are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a sysop who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
And worst, one who is despised.

If you don&apos;t trust the users,
you make them untrustworthy.

The Guru doesn&apos;t talk, he hacks.
When his work is done,
the users say, &quot;Amazing:
we implemented it, all by ourselves!&quot;
</string>
		<string>When the leaders speak of peace
The common folk know
That war is coming
When the leaders curse war

		<string>When users see one GUI as beautiful,
other user interfaces become ugly.
When users see some programs as winners,
other programs become lossage.

Pointers and NULLs reference each other.
High level and assembler depend on each other.
Double and float cast to each other.
High-endian and low-endian define each other.
While and until follow each other.

Therefore the Guru 
programs without doing anything
and teaches without saying anything.
Warnings arise and he lets them come;
processes are swapped and he lets them go.
He has but doesn&apos;t possess,
acts but doesn&apos;t expect.
When his work is done, he deletes it.
That is why it lasts forever.

		<string>When you and I are far apart
Can sorrow break your tender heart?

With care read the first word of each line.
You will find a question of mine.

		<string>When you get what you want in your struggle for self
And the world makes you king for a day,
Just go to a mirror and look at yourself
And see what that man has to say.
	For it isn&apos;t your father or mother or wife
	Whose judgement upon you must pass;
	The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
	Is the one staring back from the glass.
Some people may think you a straight-shootin&apos; chum
And call you a wonderful guy,
But the man in the glass says you&apos;re only a bum
If you can&apos;t look him straight in the eye.
	He&apos;s the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,
	For he&apos;s with you clear up to the end,
	And you&apos;ve passed your most dangerous, difficult test
	If the man in the glass is your friend.
You may fool the whole world down the pathway of life
And get pats on the back as you pass,
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears
If you&apos;ve cheated the man in the glass.

		<string>When you overesteem great hackers,
more users become cretins.
When you develop encryption,
more users become crackers.

The Guru leads
by emptying user&apos;s minds
and increasing their quotas,
by weakening their ambition
and toughening their resolve.
When users lack knowledge and desire,
management will not try to interfere.

Practice not-looping,
and everything will fall into place.

		<string>Whenever Richard Cory went downtown,
	We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
	Clean-favored, and imperially slim.
And he was always quietly arrayed,
	And he was always human when he talked;
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
	&quot;Good morning,&quot; and he glittered when he walked.
And he was rich -- yes, richer than a king --
	And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
	To make us wish that we were in his place.
So on we worked, and waited for the light,
	And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
	Went home and put a bullet through his head.

Professor Doberman:
	While the preceding poem is unarguably a change from the guarded 
pessimism of &quot;The Hound of Heaven,&quot; it cannot be regarded as an unqualified 
improvement.  Obscurity is of value only when it tends to clarify the poetic
experience.  As much as one is compelled to admire the poem&apos;s technique, one 
must question whether its byplay of complex literary allusions does not in 
fact distract from the unity of the whole.  In the final analysis, one 
receives the distinct impression that the poem&apos;s length could safely have 
been reduced by a factor of eight or ten without sacrificing any of its
meaning.  It is to be hoped that further publication of this poem can be 
suspended pending a thorough investigation of its potential subversive 
implications.

		<string>Yesterday upon the stair
I met a man who wasn&apos;t there.
He wasn&apos;t there again today --
I think he&apos;s from the CIA.
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old, Father William,&quot; the young man said,
	&quot;All your papers these days look the same;
Those William&apos;s would be better unread --
	Do these facts never fill you with shame?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; Father William replied to his son,
	&quot;I wrote wonderful papers galore;
But the great reputation I found that I&apos;d won,
	Made it pointless to think any more.&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old, father William,&quot; the young man said,
	&quot;And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head --
	Do you think, at your age, it is right?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; father William replied to his son,
	&quot;I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I&apos;m perfectly sure I have none,
	Why, I do it again and again.&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,
	And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door --
	Pray what is the reason of that?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
	&quot;I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box --
	Allow me to sell you a couple?&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and I&apos;m told by my peers
	That your lectures bore people to death.
Yet you talk at one hundred conventions per year --
	Don&apos;t you think that you should save your breath?&quot;

&quot;I have answered three questions and that is enough,&quot;
	Said his father, &quot;Don&apos;t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
	Be off, or I&apos;ll kick you downstairs!&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your jaws are too weak
	For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak --
	Pray, how did you manage to do it?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said his father, &quot;I took to the law,
	And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
	Has lasted the rest of my life.&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;one would hardly suppose
	That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose --
	What made you so awfully clever?&quot;

&quot;I have answered three questions, and that is enough,&quot;
	Said his father.  &quot;Don&apos;t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
	Be off, or I&apos;ll kick you down stairs!&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your programs don&apos;t run,
	And there isn&apos;t one language you like;
Yet of useful suggestions for help you have none --
	Have you thought about taking a hike?&quot;

&quot;Since I never write programs,&quot; his father replied,
	&quot;Every language looks equally bad;
Yet the people keep paying to read all my books
	And don&apos;t realize that they&apos;ve been had.&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,
	And make errors few people could bear;
You complain about everyone&apos;s English but yours --
	Do you really think this is quite fair?&quot;

&quot;I make lots of mistakes,&quot; Father William declared,
	&quot;But my stature these days is so great
That no critic can hurt me -- I&apos;ve got them all scared,
	And to stop me it&apos;s now far too late.&quot;

You can grovel with your boss, and it never has to end.

You can grovel in a hallway, you can grovel in a park,
You can grovel in an alley with a mugger after dark.

You can grovel with your uncle, you can grovel with your aunt,
You can grovel with your Apple, even though you say you can&apos;t.

		<string>You go down to the pickup station,
	craving warmth and beauty;
You settle for less than fascination --
	a few drinks later you&apos;re not so choosy.
And the closing lights strip off the shadows

Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
	you hurry to the blackness
	and the blankets to lay down an impression
	and your loneliness.

		<string>A large spider in an old house built a beautiful web in which to catch flies.
Every time a fly landed on the web and was entangled in it the spider devoured
him, so that when another fly came along he would think the web was a safe and
quiet place in which to rest.  One day a fairly intelligent fly buzzed around
above the web so long without lighting that the spider appeared and said,
&quot;Come on down.&quot;  But the fly was too clever for him and said, &quot;I never light
where I don&apos;t see other flies and I don&apos;t see any other flies in your house.&quot;
So he flew away until he came to a place where there were a great many other
flies.  He was about to settle down among them when a bee buzzed up and said,
&quot;Hold it, stupid, that&apos;s flypaper.  All those flies are trapped.&quot;  &quot;Don&apos;t be
silly,&quot; said the fly, &quot;they&apos;re dancing.&quot;  So he settled down and became stuck
to the flypaper with all the other flies.

Moral:  There is no safety in numbers, or in anything else.

		<string>	A MODERN FABLE

Aesop&apos;s fables and other traditional children&apos;s stories involve allegory
far too subtle for the youth of today.  Children need an updated message
with contemporary circumstance and plot line, and short enough to suit
today&apos;s minute attention span.

	The Troubled Aardvark

Once upon a time, there was an aardvark whose only pleasure in life was
driving from his suburban bungalow to his job at a large brokerage house
in his brand new 4x4.  He hated his manipulative boss, his conniving and
unethical co-workers, his greedy wife, and his snivelling, spoiled
children.  One day, the aardvark reflected on the meaning of his life and
his career and on the unchecked, catastrophic decline of his nation, its
pathetic excuse for leadership, and the complete ineffectiveness of any
personal effort he could make to change the status quo.  Overcome by a
wave of utter depression and self-doubt, he decided to take the only
course of action that would bring him greater comfort and happiness: he
drove to the mall and bought imported consumer electronics goods.

MORAL OF THE STORY:  Invest in foreign consumer electronics manufacturers.

If Sigismund Unbuckle had taken a walk in 1426 and met Wat Tyler, the
Peasant&apos;s Revolt would never have happened and the motor car would not
have been invented until 2026, which would have meant that all the oil
could have been used for lamps, thus saving the electric light bulb and
the whale, and nobody would have caught Moby Dick or Billy Budd.

on the other side. It comes from the phrase vos otros, meaning others.
They&apos;re the huge, fat, middle waist.  The archetype is an Irish drunk
clown with red hair and nose, and pale skin.  Fields, William Bendix.
Everybody tends to drift toward Bozoness.  It has Oz in it.  They mean

		<string>First, a few words about tools.

Basically, a tool is an object that enables you to take advantage of the
laws of physics and mechanics in such a way that you can seriously injure
yourself.  Today, people tend to take tools for granted.  If you&apos;re ever
walking down the street and you notice some people who look particularly
smug, the odds are that they are taking tools for granted.  If I were you,
I&apos;d walk right up and smack them in the face.

	*Three* shall be the number of the counting, and the number of the
	counting shall be three.  *Four* shalt thou not count, and neither

had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But
conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more
intelligent than man -- for precisely the same reasons.

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending
destruction of the of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to
alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were
misinterpreted ...

		<string>Like you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questions related to man&apos;s
place in the Scheme of Things.  Here are just a few:

	Q -- Is there life after death?
	A -- Definitely.  I speak from personal experience here.  On New
Year&apos;s Eve, 1970, I drank a full pitcher of a drink called &quot;Black Russian&quot;,
then crawled out on the lawn and died within a matter of minutes, which was
fine with me because I had come to realize that if I had lived I would have
spent the rest of my life in the grip of the most excruciatingly painful
headache.  Thanks to the miracle of modern orange juice, I was brought back
to life several days later, but in the interim I was definitely dead.  I
guess my main impression of the afterlife is that it isn&apos;t so bad as long
as you keep the television turned down and don&apos;t try to eat any solid foods.

		<string>	My friends, I am here to tell you of the wonderous continent known as
Africa.  Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.
We were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in
Africa.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at
6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by
6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That
was the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Moose
and Knights of Pithiests.
	The elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their
annual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,
which they leave immediately when they discover it&apos;s full of water.  They
weren&apos;t looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.
	One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my
pajamas, I don&apos;t know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That&apos;s a tough
word to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were
imbedded so firmly we couldn&apos;t get them out.  But in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,
but that is totally irrelephant to what I was saying.
	We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren&apos;t developed.
So we&apos;re going back in a few years...

		<string>Thank goodness modern convenience is a thing of the remote future.
		-- Pogo, by Walt Kelly

		<string>The basic idea behind malls is that they are more convenient than cities.
Cities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowded and difficult to
park in.  Malls, on the other hand, have parking lots, which are also
dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but -- here is the big
difference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO RULES.  You&apos;re allowed to
do anything.  You can drive as fast as you want in any direction you want.
I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car was struck by a pickup
truck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that said &quot;Charlie&quot;
on his forearm, who got out and explained to me, in great detail, why the
accident was my fault, his reasoning being that he was violent and muscular,
whereas I was neither.  This kind of reasoning is legally valid in mall
parking lots.

the subject of towels.
	Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a
toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,
the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or
a dozen other items that he may have &quot;lost&quot;.  After all, any man who can
hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds,
win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned with.

you get a divorce so I can marry her.  If you win, I promise never to see
her again.  Okay?&quot;

		<string>A man sank into the psychiatrist&apos;s couch and said, &quot;I have a
terrible problem, Doctor.  I have a son at Harvard and another son at
Princeton; I&apos;ve just gifted each of them with a new Ferrari; I&apos;ve got
homes in Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, and a co-op in New York; and I&apos;ve
got a thriving ranch in Venezuela.  My wife is a gorgeous young actress
who considers my two mistresses to be her best friends.&quot;

something?  It sounds to me like you have no problems at all.&quot;

		<string>A man took his wife deer hunting for the first time.  After he&apos;d given her
some basic instructions, they agreed to separate and rendezvous later.  Before
he left, he warned her if she should fell a deer to be wary of hunters who
might beat her to the carcass and claim the kill.  If that happened, he told
her, she should fire her gun three times into the air and he would come to
her aid.  
	Shortly after they separated, he heard a single shot, followed quickly
by the agreed upon signal.  Running to the scene, he found his wife standing
in a small clearing with a very nervous man staring down her gun barrel.
	&quot;He claims this is his,&quot; she said, obviously very upset.
	&quot;She can keep it, she can keep it!&quot; the wide-eyed man replied.  &quot;I

		<string>A man was griping to his friend about how he hated to go home after a
late card games.
	&quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe what I go through to avoid waking my wife,&quot;
he said.  &quot;First, I kill the engine a block away from the house and coast
into the garage.  Then I open the door slowly, take off my shoes, and
tiptoe to our room.  But just as I&apos;m about to slide into bed, she always
wakes up and gives me hell.&quot;
	&quot;I make a big racket when I go home,&quot; his friend replied.
	&quot;You do?&quot;
	&quot;Sure.  I honk the horn, slam the door, turn on all the lights,
stomp up to the bedroom and give my wife a big kiss.  `Hi, Alice,&apos; I say.
`How about a little smooch for your old man?&apos;&quot;
	&quot;And what does she say?&quot; his friend asked in disbelief.
	&quot;She doesn&apos;t say anything,&quot; his buddy replied.  &quot;She always pretends
she&apos;s asleep.&quot;

		<string>A man was kneeling by a grave in a cemetery, crying and praying very loudly,
	&quot;Oh why..eeeee did you die...eeeeee, Oh Why..eeeeee,

The caretaker walks up, pardons himself and asks politely,
	&quot;Excuse me, sir, but I&apos;ve been seeing you for hours now,
carrying on at this grave.  You must have been very close to the deceased.&quot;
	&quot;No, I never met him.  Oh why....eeeee did you dieeeeee,
why....eeeee did you..&quot;
	&quot;Sir, you say you never met this person, yet you carry on so?
Tell, me who is buried here?&quot;

		<string>A man was talking to his best friend about his married life.  &quot;You know,&quot; he
says, &quot;I really trust my wife, and I think she has always been faithful to
me, but there&apos;s *always* that doubt.  There&apos;s *always* that little doubt.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean,&quot; his friend replies.
	&quot;Well, buddy, I&apos;ve got to leave on a business trip this weekend,
and I wonder... well... would you watch my house while I&apos;m gone?  I trust
her, it&apos;s just that there&apos;s *always* that doubt.&quot;
	The friend agreed to help out and two weeks later gave his report.
	&quot;I&apos;ve got some bad news for you,&quot; says the friend.  &quot;The evening
after you left I saw a strange car pull up in front of your house.  A man
got out of the car and went in the house and had dinner with your wife.
After dinner they went upstairs and I saw your wife kissing him.  Then, he
took off his shirt and she took off her blouse.  And then the light went
out.&quot;
	&quot;*Then* what happened?&quot; said the husband, his eyes opening wide.
	&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied the friend, &quot;it was too dark to see.&quot;
	&quot;Damn!&quot; roared the husband.  &quot;You see what I mean?  There&apos;s *always*
that doubt!&quot;

		<string>	A Scotsman was strolling across High Street one day wearing his kilt.
As he neared the far curb, he noticed two young blondes in a red convertible
eyeing him and giggling.  One of them called out, &quot;Hey, Scotty!  What&apos;s worn
under the kilt?&quot;
	He strolled over to the side of the car and asked, &quot;Ach, lass, are you
SURE you want to know?&quot;  Somewhat nervously, the blonde replied yes, she did
really want to know.
	The Scotsman leaned closer and confided, &quot;Why, lass, nothing&apos;s worn
under the kilt, everything&apos;s in perfect workin&apos; order!&quot;
</string>
		<string>A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist
thought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the
problem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male
aggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy
away from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman&apos;s
participation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility
will appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to
men.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to
idealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by
the system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own
submission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to
is to substitute moral outrage for analysis.

		<string>A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing the
consequences and implications of a married man&apos;s having a mistress.  The
sociologist&apos;s opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivable
for a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowly
and lustful pursuits.
	The psychologist&apos;s opinion was that although morally reprehensible,
if a man MUST have a mistress to achieve his full potential as a human being,
then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a mistress, as long as he
is considerate enough to keep this secret from his wife.
	The engineer then interjected: &quot;I also believe that, if necessary,
a married man is entitled to a mistress.  However, I do not see why the
affair should be concealed from the wife.  On the contrary, if the affair
is out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that he
is going to see his mistress, tell his mistress that he is going to be with
his wife, then go to his office and get some work done!&quot;

	&quot;No problem,&quot; he said, throwing a brick through the window and grabbing
the coat.

		<string>A young man enters the New York branch of Tiffany&apos;s on a Friday evening and
walks up to a display case full of pearl necklaces.  He turns to a gorgeous
woman, who is obviously windowshopping, looks her straight in the eye and
says, &quot;I can tell by your eyes that you really want that necklace.  If you&apos;ll
allow me, I&apos;d like to buy it for you.&quot;
	The woman looks him up and down; he&apos;s wearing a nice suit and some
pretty nice jewelry, but she has trouble believing this story.
	&quot;Look, this is some kind of put on, right?&quot;
	&quot;No, really.  You see, I&apos;ve got quite a lot of money -- so much that
I could never spend it all.  I&apos;d really like for you to have it.&quot;
	The guys whips out his checkbook, writes a check for five figures,
calls over a clerk and hands it to him.  The clerk peers at the check, looks
at the young man, looks at the check again.  &quot;Very good, sir.  I&apos;m afraid I
can&apos;t release the necklace immediately, would Monday be all right?&quot;
	&quot;That&apos;ll be fine, she&apos;ll pick it up.&quot; the man replies, and walks out
of the store with the woman following him in a daze.
	The next Monday the man comes back in and walks up to the counter.
The same clerk hurries over to him and says, &quot;Sir, I&apos;m sorry to have to tell
you this, but your check was returned for insufficient funds.&quot;
	&quot;I know,&quot; the man replies.  &quot;I just wanted to thank you for a
terrific weekend.&quot;

		<string>American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise
is going to own one and want to travel great distances in it.  Consequently,
any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacations
in a car, probing into unfamiliar corners.  She is not required to know how
to drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while her
husband drives, and if she can&apos;t, or if she&apos;s abnormally slow in giving him
help, she&apos;s bound to cause trouble.  Therefore, you&apos;d think that colleges
which train the bright young women who&apos;re going to marry the bright young
men who are going to own the Cadillacs that roar back and forth across this
continent would teach the girls to read maps.  None do. They teach a hundred
other useless things, but never a word about the one that will cause the
greatest friction.

</string>
		<string>And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to
have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon
the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let
loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price:
in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest
license of a child, and yet been man enough to know its value.

		<string>Another greeting card category consists of those persons who send out
photographs of their families every year.  In the same mail that brought the
greetings from Marcia and Philip, my friend found such a conversation piece.
&quot;My God, Lida is enormous!&quot; she exclaimed.  I don&apos;t know why women want to
record each year, for two or three hundred people to see, the ravages wrought
upon them, their mates, and their progeny by the artillery of time, but
between five and seven per cent of Christmas cards, at a rough estimate, are
family groups, and even the most charitable recipient studies them for little
signs of dissolution or derangement.  Nothing cheers a woman more, I am afraid,
than the proof that another woman is letting herself go, or has lost control
of her figure, or is clearly driving her husband crazy, or is obviously
drinking more than is good for her, or still doesn&apos;t know what to wear.
Middle-aged husbands in such photographs are often described as looking
&quot;young enough to be her son,&quot; but they don&apos;t always escape so easily, and a
couple opening envelopes in the season of mercy and good will sometimes handle
a male friend or acquaintance rather sharply.  &quot;Good Lord!&quot; the wife will say.
&quot;Frank looks like a sex-crazed shotgun slayer, doesn&apos;t he?&quot;  &quot;Not to me,&quot; the
husband may reply.  &quot;to me he looks more like a Wilkes-Barre dentist who is
being sought by the police in connection with the disappearance of a choir
singer.&quot;

		<string>Asked how she felt being the first woman to make a major-league team, she
said, &quot;Like a pig in mud,&quot; or words to that effect, and then turned and
released a squirt of tobacco juice from the wad of rum soaked plug in her
right cheek.  She chewed a rare brand of plug called Stuff It, which she
learned to chew when she was playing Nicaraguan summer ball.  She told the
writers, &quot;They were so mean to me down there you couldn&apos;t write it in your
newspaper.  I took a gun everywhere I went, even to bed.  *Especially* to
bed.  Guys were after me like you can&apos;t believe.  That&apos;s when I started
chewing tobacco -- because no matter how bad anybody treats you, it&apos;s not
as bad as this.  This is the worst chew in the world.  After this,
everything else is peaches and cream.&quot;  The writers elected Gentleman Jim,
the Sparrow&apos;s P.R. guy, to bite off a chunk and tell them how it tasted,
and as he sat and chewed it tears ran down his old sunburnt cheeks and he
couldn&apos;t talk for a while. Then he whispered, &quot;You&apos;ve been chewing this for

This morning, I was waiting for a bus in comparative comfort, my umbrella
protecting me from the downpour, and noticed an attractive young woman getting
soaked.  I have often seen her at my bus stop, although we have never spoken,
and I don&apos;t even know her name.  Could I have asked her to get under my
umbrella without seeming insulting?

Gentle Reader:
Certainly.  Consideration for those less fortunate than you is always proper,
although it would be more convincing if you stopped babbling about how
attractive she is.  In order not to give Good Samaritanism a bad name, Miss
Manners asks you to allow her two or three rainy days of unmolested protection
before making your attack.

Please list some tactful ways of removing a man&apos;s saliva from your face.

Gentle Reader:
Please list some decent ways of acquiring a man&apos;s saliva on your face. If
the gentleman sprayed you inadvertently to accompany enthusiastic
discourse, you may step back two paces, bring out your handkerchief, and
go through the motions of wiping your nose, while trailing the cloth along
your face to pick up whatever needs mopping along the route.  If, however,
the substance was acquired as a result of enthusiasm of a more intimate
nature, you may delicately retrieve it with a flick of your pink tongue.

Low Blows:
	Let&apos;s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV.  One
of the boxers is felled by a low blow.  The woman says &quot;Oh, gee.  That must
hurt.&quot; The man doubles over and actually FEELS the pain.

Dressing Up:
	A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the
garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail.   A man will dress up
for: weddings, funerals.  Speaking of weddings, when reminiscing about
weddings, women talk about &quot;the ceremony&quot;.  Men laugh about &quot;the bachelor
party&quot;.

David Letterman:
	Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the
Earth.  Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.

Relationships:
	First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship -- he
refers to it as &quot;that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regular
basis&quot;.
	When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to
her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled &quot;All Men Are Idiots&quot;.  Then
she will get on with her life.
	A man has a little more trouble letting go.  Six months after the
breakup, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, &quot;I just
wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I&apos;ll never forgive you, and I
hate you, and you&apos;re a total floozy.  But I want you to know that there&apos;s
always a chance for us&quot;.  This is known as the &quot;I Hate You / I Love You&quot;
drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once.  There are
community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas,
these classes rarely prove effective.

Shoes:
	 The average man has 4 pairs of footwear: running shoes, dress shoes,
boots, and slippers.  The average woman has shoes 4 layers thick on the floor
of her closet.  Most of them hurt her feet.
 
Making friends:
	 A woman will meet another woman with common interests, do a few things
together, and say something like, &quot;I hope we can be good friends.&quot;
	A man will meet another man with common interests, do a few things
together, and say nothing.  After years of interacting with this other man,
sharing hopes and fears that he wouldn&apos;t confide in his priest or

Desserts:
	A woman will generally admire an ornate dessert for the artistic
work it is, praising its creator and waiting a suitable interval before
she reluctantly takes a small sliver off one edge.  A man will start by
grabbing the cherry in the center.

Car repair:
	The average man thinks his Y chromosome contains complete repair
manuals for every car made since World War II.  He will work on a problem
himself until it either goes away or turns into something that &quot;can&apos;t be
fixed without special tools&quot;.
	The average woman thinks &quot;that funny thump-thump noise&quot; is an
accurate description of an automotive problem.  She will, however, have the
car serviced at the proper intervals and thereby incur fewer problems than
the average man.
</string>
		<string>FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#4

Clothes:
	Men don&apos;t discard clothes.  The average man still has the gym shirt
he wore in high school.  He thinks a jacket is &quot;just getting broken in&quot; about
the time it develops holes in the elbows.  A man will let new shirts sit on
the shelf in their original packaging for a couple of years before putting
them to use, hoping they&apos;ll become more comfortable with age.
	Women think clothes are radioactive, with a half-life of one year.
They exercise precautions to avoid contamination by last year&apos;s fashions.

Trust:
	The average woman would really like to be told if her mate is fooling
around behind her back.  This same woman wouldn&apos;t tell her best friend if
she knew the best friends&apos; mate was having an affair.  She&apos;ll tell all her
OTHER friends, however.  The average man won&apos;t say anything if he knows that
one of his friend&apos;s mates is fooling around, and he&apos;d rather not know if
his mate is having an affair either, out of fear that it might be with one
of his friends.  He will tell all his friends about his own affairs, though,
so they can be ready if he needs an alibi.

Driving:
	A typical man thinks he&apos;s Mario Andretti as soon as he slips behind
the wheel of his car.  The fact that it&apos;s an 8-year-old Honda doesn&apos;t keep
him from trying to out-accelerate the guy in the Porsche who&apos;s attempting
to cut him off; freeway on-ramps are exciting challenges to see who has The
Right Stuff on the morning commute.  Does he or doesn&apos;t he?  Only his body
shop knows for sure.  Insurance companies understand this behavior, and
price their policies accordingly.
	A woman will slow down to let a car merge in front of her, and get

Bathrooms:
	A man has six items in his bathroom -- a toothbrush, toothpaste,
shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn.
The average number of items in the typical woman&apos;s bathroom is 437.  A man
would not be able to identify most of these items.

Groceries:
	A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store
and buys these things.  A man waits &apos;til the only items left in his fridge
are half a lime and a Blue Ribbon.  Then he goes grocery shopping.  He buys
everything that looks good.  By the time a man reaches the checkout counter,
his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett&apos;s car on Beverly Hillbillies.
Of course, this will not stop him from entering the 10-items-or-less lane.

checks on the kids, makes a phone call to her best friend...

Cats:
	Women love cats.  Men say they love cats, but when women aren&apos;t
looking, men kick cats.

Offspring:
	Ah, children.  A woman knows all about her children.  She knows
about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends
and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams.  Men are vaguely

Laundry:
	Women do laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every article
of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight
years ago, before he will do his laundry.  When he is finally out of clothes,
he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain
of clothes to the laundromat.  Men always expect to meet beautiful women at
the laundromat.  This is a myth.

Nicknames:
	If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle get together for lunch,
they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle.  But if
Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately
refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut Brain and Useless.

Socks:
	Men wear sensible socks.  They wear standard white sweatsocks.
Women wear strange socks.  They are cut way below the ankles, have pictures
of clouds on them, and have a big fuzzy ball on the back.

		<string>			-- Gifts for Men --

Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional ice
hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you should
never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes they
will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example, your average
man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,
through humiliating trial and error, that if he wears any of the other 81
ties, his wife will probably laugh at him (&quot;You&apos;re not going to wear THAT
tie with that suit, are you?&quot;). So he has narrowed it down to three safe
ties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give him
a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.

If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.  More than
once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of tires.

a lot less than my idea of perfection.  But one day, after many years

		<string>	It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.  Your parents will
not be pleased with this plan, because they want you all to themselves and
because in the presence of your friend, they will have to act like mature
human beings.
	The worst kind of friend to take home is a girl, because in that case,
there is the potential that your parents will lose you not just for the 
duration of the visit but forever.  The worst kind of girl to take home is one
of a different religion:  Not only will you be lost to your parents forever but
you will be lost to a woman who is immune to their religious/moral arguments
and whose example will irretrievably corrupt you.
	Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve fallen in love with just such a girl and would like
to take her home for the holidays.  You are aware of your parents&apos; xenophobic
response to anyone of a different religion.  How to prepare them for the shock?
	Simple.  Call them up shortly before your visit and tell them that you
have gotten quite serious about somebody who is of a different religion, a
different race and the same sex.  Tell them you have already invited this
person to meet them.  Give the information a moment to sink in and then 
remark that you were only kidding, that your lover is merely of a different
religion.  They will be so relieved they will welcome her with open arms.

from the roof running down the back of his neck as he stood on the stoop.
The next time he knocked louder, but still no answer.  By now he was soaked
to the skin.  Desperately he pounded on the door.  At last the head of a
man appeared out of an upstairs window.
	&quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked gruffly.

		<string>	Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a stroll 
through the woods.  All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seated 
on a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.  &quot;Maiden,&quot; croaked the
frog, &quot;would you do me a favor?  This will be hard for you to believe, but
I was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch cast
a spell over me and turned me into a frog.&quot;
	&quot;Oh, what a pity!&quot;, exclaimed the girl.  &quot;I&apos;ll do anything I can to
help you break such a spell.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; replied the frog, &quot;the only way that this spell can be
taken away is for some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spend
the night under her pillow.&quot;
	The young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath her
pillow that night when she retired.  When she awoke the next morning, sure
enough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly of
royal blood.  And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this day
her father and mother still don&apos;t believe her story.

		<string>	Once upon a time there were three brothers who were knights
in a certain kingdom.  And, there was a Princess in a neighboring kingdom
who was of marriageable age.  Well, one day, in full armour, their horses,
and their page, the three brothers set off to see if one of them could
win her hand.  The road was long and there were many obstacles along the
way, robbers to be overcome, hard terrain to cross.  As they coped with
each obstacle they became more and more disgusted with their page.  He was
not only inept, he was a coward, he could not handle the horses, he was,
in short, a complete flop.  When they arrived at the court of the kingdom,
they found that they were expected to present the Princess with some
treasure.  The two older brothers were discouraged, since they had not
thought of this and were unprepared.  The youngest, however, had the
answer:  Promise her anything, but give her our page.
</string>
		<string>	One evening he spoke.  Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her,
he allowed his soul to be heard.  &quot;My darling, anything you wish, anything
I am, anything I can ever be...  That&apos;s what I want to offer you -- not the
things I&apos;ll get for you, but the thing in me that will make me able to get
them.  That thing -- a man can&apos;t renounce it -- but I want to renounce it -- so
that it will be yours -- so that it will be in your service -- only for you.&quot;
	The girl smiled and asked: &quot;Do you think I&apos;m prettier than Maggie
Kelly?&quot;
	He got up.  He said nothing and walked out of the house.  He never
saw that girl again.  Gail Wynand, who prided himself on never needing a
lesson twice, did not fall in love again in the years that followed.

		<string>Only two groups of people fall for flattery -- men and women.
</string>
		<string>	People of all sorts of genders are reporting great difficulty,
these days, in selecting the proper words to refer to those of the female
persuasion.
	&quot;Lady,&quot; &quot;woman,&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; are all perfectly good words, but
misapplying them can earn one anything from the charge of vulgarity to a good
swift smack.  We are messing here with matters of deference, condescension,
respect, bigotry, and two vague concepts, age and rank.  It is troubling
enough to get straight who is really what.  Those who deliberately misuse
the terms in a misbegotten attempt at flattery are asking for it.
	A woman is any grown-up female person.  A girl is the un-grown-up
version.  If you call a wee thing with chubby cheeks and pink hair ribbons a
&quot;woman,&quot; you will probably not get into trouble, and if you do, you will be
able to handle it because she will be under three feet tall.  However, if you
call a grown-up by a child&apos;s name for the sake of implying that she has a
youthful body, you are also implying that she has a brain to match.

Ted:	ALL?  Do you realize what you&apos;re asking?  Men aren&apos;t trained
	to share.  We&apos;re trained to protect ourselves by not
	letting anyone too close.  Good grief, if I go around
	sharing everything with you, you could hang me out to dry.
Sally:	It&apos;s called &quot;trust,&quot; Ted.

		<string>	Young men and young women may work systematically six days in the
week and rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend modern dances for
only a few hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka,
Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects
to both sexes.  Health and vigor will vanish like the dew before the sun.
	It is not the extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, but
rather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.  It is the
fury of lust craving incessantly for more pleasure that undermines the
soul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics show
beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach
twenty-five years of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached that
age they will in most instances be broken in health physically and morally.
This is the claim of prominent physicians in this country.

		<string>A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who 
had ever reached the Enlightenment &apos;Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether 
various objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue 
invariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake, 
and a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and 
asked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop 
between his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex 
string which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk 
was enlightened. 

From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after 
string by Tortue&apos;s method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples, 
who passed it on to theirs.

to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&quot; he finally said.

satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&quot;

refused it, saying, &quot;I wrote the program because I though it was an interesting
concept, and thus I expect no reward.&quot;
	The manager, upon hearing this, remarked, &quot;This programmer, though he
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an
employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!&quot;
	But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, &quot;I exist

take it I assign ten programmers to it?&quot;
	The master programmer frowned.  &quot;In that case, it will take two years.&quot;

&quot;I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,

human.&quot;

crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the
need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He

the Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.  Why
do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?  Computers
simulate determinism; only the Tao is perfect.
	The rules of programming are transitory; only the Tao is eternal.
Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment.&quot;

much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a giant

Why is this so?&quot;
	The master replied, &quot;Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That
company is large because it is so large.  If it only made hardware, nobody
would buy it.  If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a
servant.  But because it combines all of these things, people think it one
of the gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.&quot;

		<string>	A novice asked the master: &quot;In the east there is a great tree-structure
that men call &apos;Corporate Headquarters&apos;.  It is bloated out of shape with
vice-presidents and accountants.  It issues a multitude of memos, each saying
&apos;Go, Hence!&apos; or &apos;Go, Hither!&apos; and nobody knows what is meant.  Every year new
names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail.  How can such an
unnatural entity exist?&quot;
	The master replies: &quot;You perceive this immense structure and are
disturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement from
its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming
beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by its uselessness?&quot;

replying.
	&quot;I don&apos;t see why not.  It&apos;s got bloody well everything else.&quot;
	With that, the Chief Priest went to lunch.  The novice suddenly
achieved enlightenment, several years later.

		<string>	A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial
package.
	The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master
reviewed his program, he discovered that it contained a screen editor, a set
of generalized graphics routines, and artificial intelligence interface,
but not the slightest mention of anything financial.
	When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.
&quot;Don&apos;t be so impatient,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ll put the financial stuff in eventually.&quot;

		<string>A person who is more than casually interested in computers should be well
schooled in machine language, since it is a fundamental part of a computer.
		-- Donald Knuth
</string>
		<string>	A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
strings of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be retained
throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much, neither needless
loops nor useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming
rigidity.
	A program should follow the &apos;Law of Least Astonishment&apos;.  What is this
law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the
way that astonishes him least.
	A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The
program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward
appearances.
	If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite the
program.

		<string>	A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software
conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: &quot;What sort
of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and were
unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their
clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality suites and they
made rude noises during my presentation.&quot;
	The manager said: &quot;I should have never sent you to the conference.
Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life absurd,

		<string>A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of

dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of
annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was

		<string>	A sheet of paper crossed my desk the other day and as I read it,
realization of a basic truth came over me.  So simple!  So obvious we couldn&apos;t
see it.  John Knivlen, Chairman of Polamar Repeater Club, an amateur radio
group, had discovered how IC circuits work.  He says that smoke is the thing
that makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,
it stops working.  He claims to have verified this with thorough testing.
	I was flabbergasted!  Of course!  Smoke makes all things electrical
work.  Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator
Didn&apos;t it quit working?  I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth
dawned.  It&apos;s the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to
another in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets
the smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor
requires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that&apos;s why the wire
going to it is so large.
	Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas
electronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is
British, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,
British engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and
I might add Brititsh tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks

CAR and CDR now return extra values.

The function CAR now returns two values.  Since it has to go to the trouble 
to figure out if the object is carcdr-able anyway, we figured you might as 
well get both halves at once.  For example, the following code shows how to 
destructure a cons (SOME-CONS) into its two slots (THE-CAR and THE-CDR):

	(MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (THE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...)

For symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a second value which is the CAR of the
object.  In a related change, the functions MAKE-ARRAY and CONS have been 
fixed so they don&apos;t allocate any storage except on the stack.  This should
hopefully help people who don&apos;t like using the garbage collector because
it cold boots the machine so often.

Compiler optimizations have been made to macro expand LET into a WITHOUT-

Note that LET *could* have been defined by:

	(LET ((LET &apos;`(LET ((LET &apos;,LET))
			,LET)))
	`(LET ((LET &apos;,LET))
		,LET))

This is believed to speed up execution by as much as a factor of 1.01 or

JCL support as alternative to system menu.

In our continuing effort to support languages other than LISP on the CADDR,
we have developed an OS/360-compatible JCL.  This can be used as an
alternative to the standard system menu.  Type System J to get to a JCL
interactive read-execute-diagnose loop window.  [Note that for 360
compatibility, all input lines are truncated to 80 characters.]  This
window also maintains a mouse-sensitive display of critical job parameters
such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channels, etc.  When a JCL
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, the window-oriented JCL
debugger is entered.  The JCL debugger displays appropriate OS/360 error
messages (such as IEC703, &quot;disk error&quot;) and allows you to dequeue your job.

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage 
collection algorithm has been installed.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,
(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when 
virtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-
QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage
collectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather 
than from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly 
more Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like &quot;Do you
remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?&quot;, and if you can&apos;t give a reasonable answer
in thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable 
SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.

		<string>... an anecdote from IBM&apos;s Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a
programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting
down, but he couldn&apos;t log in to the system when he was standing up.  That
behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and
never when standing.

Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal
know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,
know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to
hypothesize: was there a loose with under the carpet, or problems with static
electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.
An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal&apos;s keyboard:
the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a
touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led
astray by hunting and pecking.

		<string>Dear Emily, what about test messages?
		-- Concerned

Dear Concerned:
	It is important, when testing, to test the entire net.  Never test
merely a subnet distribution when the whole net can be done.  Also put &quot;please
ignore&quot; on your test messages, since we all know that everybody always skips
a message with a line like that.  Don&apos;t use a subject like &quot;My sex is female
but I demand to be addressed as male.&quot; because such articles are read in depth
by all USEnauts.

		<string>Dear Emily:

		-- Confused

Dear Confused:
	Pick as many as you can, so that you get the widest audience.  After
all, the net exists to give you an audience.  Ignore those who suggest you
should only use groups where you think the article is highly appropriate.
Pick all groups where anybody might even be slightly interested.
	Always make sure followups go to all the groups.  In the rare event
that you post a followup which contains something original, make sure you
expand the list of groups.  Never include a &quot;Followup-to:&quot; line in the
header, since some people might miss part of the valuable discussion in
the fringe groups.

looks like a reply to the original.  Everybody *loves* to read those long

		-- A Concerned Citizen

Dear Concerned:
	Go to the daily papers.  Most modern reporters are top-notch computer
experts who will understand the net, and your problems, perfectly.  They
will print careful, reasoned stories without any errors at all, and surely
represent the situation properly to the public.  The public will also all
act wisely, as they are also fully cognizant of the subtle nature of net
society.
	Papers never sensationalize or distort, so be sure to point out things
like racism and sexism wherever they might exist.  Be sure as well that they
understand that all things on the net, particularly insults, are meant
literally.  Link what transpires on the net to the causes of the Holocaust, if
possible.  If regular papers won&apos;t take the story, go to a tabloid paper --
they are always interested in good stories.
</string>
		<string>Dear Emily:
	I&apos;m still confused as to what groups articles should be posted
to.  How about an example?
		-- Still Confused

Dear Still:
	Ok.  Let&apos;s say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a
big trade!  Since it&apos;s a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy
as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try
news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.
	The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.
He is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also
interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to
soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn&apos;t exist, so cross-post to
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as
well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles
there, and a &quot;comp&quot; group will propagate your article further.)
	You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each
group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders
will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don&apos;t tolerate this.

it is.&quot;

	No problem, just post your message to a group that a lot of people
read.  Say, &quot;This is for John Smith.  I couldn&apos;t get mail through so I&apos;m
posting it.  All others please ignore.&quot;
	This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning
over and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours their collective
time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of checking through usenet
maps or looking for alternate routes.  Just think, if you couldn&apos;t distribute
your message to 9000 other computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call
directory assistance for 60 cents, or even phone the person.  This can cost
as much as a few DOLLARS (!) for a 5 minute call!
	And certainly it&apos;s better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people&apos;s
money distributing the message than for you to have to waste $9 on an overnight
letter, or even 25 cents on a stamp!
	Don&apos;t forget.  The world will end if your message doesn&apos;t get through,
so post it as many places as you can.

		<string>Ever wondered about the origins of the term &quot;bugs&quot; as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.
The 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in 
computer technology during World War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trators that the first computer &quot;bug&quot; was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the
&quot;granddaddy&quot; of modern computers, the Mark I.  &quot;Things were going badly;
there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed
computer,&quot; she said.  &quot;Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using
ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when
anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.&quot;  Hopper
said that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, &quot;I referred
them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in
question.&quot;
		[actually, the term &quot;bug&quot; had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]

		<string>Fellow programmer, greetings!  You are reading a letter which will bring
you luck and good fortune.  Just mail (or UUCP) ten copies of this letter
to ten of your friends.  Before you make the copies, send a chip or
other bit of hardware, and 100 lines of &apos;C&apos; code to the first person on the
list given at the bottom of this letter.  Then delete their name and add
yours to the bottom of the list.

Don&apos;t break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of San
Diego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next morning to find
his job description changed to &quot;COBOL programmer.&quot;  Fred A. of New York sent
out his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software to
build a Cray dedicated to playing Zork.  Martha H. of Chicago laughed at
this letter and broke the chain.  Shortly thereafter, a fire broke out in
her terminal and she now spends her days writing documentation for IBM PC&apos;s.

Don&apos;t break the chain!  Send out your ten copies today!
For example, if \thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \thickmskip = 6mu.  But if
you also want to use \skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or
not, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule is
that glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \mskip;
when moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor
1mu=1pt is always used.  The meaning of &apos;\mskip\skip12&apos; and
&apos;\baselineskip=\the\thickmskip&apos; should be clear.

		<string>I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and
after expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government
of England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only
commenced, I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even
the offer of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the
reach of men who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...
	If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were
a mere triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the
execution of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some
justification might be found for the course which has been taken; but I
venture to assert that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will
ever publicly express an opinion that such a machine would be useless if
made, and that no man distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to
declare the construction of such machinery impracticable...
	And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed
by that exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its
advancement, which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I
think the application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar&apos;s

it cannot be allowed to get into a state from which only direct intervention
will suffice to remove it.  An imbedded system can&apos;t permanently trust anything
it hears from the outside world.  It must sniff around, adapt, consider, sniff
around, and adapt again.  I&apos;m not talking about ordinary modular programming
carefulness here.  No.  Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted
raging maniacal paranoia.  For example, our ethernet front ends need to know
what network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs
properly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a
gateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network
numbers.  Once you&apos;ve got your network number, you start using it and before
you can blink you&apos;ve got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all
over creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he
was running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong
network number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  Supposing that your
software discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network
number than before, what&apos;s it supposed to do about it?  This is not discussed
in the protocol document.  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  I think you 
get my drift.

null, and darkness was upon the face of the console; and the Spirit of
IBM was moving over the face of the market.  And DEC said, &quot;Let there

carried; and DEC separated the data from the instructions.  DEC called
the data Stack, and the instructions they called Code.  And there was
evening and there was morning, one interrupt.

This message it drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull
making its mark upon the beach.  Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with
the blue sky at its back, returns home.
	The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands
it not.  The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears
its message.  The master programmer continues to work at his terminal, for he
does not know that the bird has come and gone.

		<string>It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but
it is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to
organize the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The
manager of architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and
I were threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.
	The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they
could write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months,
three more than the schedule allowed.
	The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they
could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating;
it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.
Furthermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling
their thumbs for ten months.
	To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control
program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time,
but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and
it was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual
integrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I would
estimate that it added a year to debugging time.

	...
	The central Superhighway site called ``sunsite.unc.edu&apos;&apos;
collapsed in the morning before the release.  News about the release had
been leaked by a German hacker group, Harmonious Hardware Hackers, who
had cracked into the author&apos;s computer earlier in the week.  They had
got the release date wrong by one day, and caused dozens of eager fans
to connect to the sunsite computer at the wrong time.  ``No computer can
handle that kind of stress,&apos;&apos; explained the mourning sunsite manager,
Erik Troan.  ``The spinning disks made the whole computer jump, and
finally it crashed through the floor to the basement.&apos;&apos;  Luckily,
repairs were swift and the computer was working again the same evening.
``Thank God we were able to buy enough needles and thread and patch it
together without major problems.&apos;&apos;  The site has also installed a new
throttle on the network pipe, allowing at most four clients at the same
time, thus making a new crash less likely.  ``The book is now in our

by staff writers

Helsinki, Finland, August 6, 1995 -- In a surprise movement, Lars
``Lasu&apos;&apos; Wirzenius today released the 0.3 edition of the ``Linux System
Administrators&apos; Guide&apos;&apos;.  Already an industry non-classic, the new
version sports such overwhelming features as an overview of a Linux
system, a completely new climbing session in a tree, and a list of
acknowledgements in the introduction.
	The SAG, as the book is affectionately called, is one of the
corner stones of the Linux Documentation Project.  ``We at the LDP feel
that we wouldn&apos;t be able to produce anything at all, that all our work
would be futile, if it weren&apos;t for the SAG,&apos;&apos; says Matt Welsh, director
of LDP, Inc.
	The new version is still distributed freely, now even with a
copyright that allows modification.  ``More dough,&apos;&apos; explains the author.
Despite insistent rumors about blatant commercialization, the SAG will
probably remain free.  ``Even more dough,&apos;&apos; promises the author.
	The author refuses to comment on Windows NT and Windows 96
versions, claiming not to understand what the question is about.
Industry gossip, however, tells that Bill Gates, co-founder and CEO of
Microsoft, producer of the Windows series of video games, has visited
Helsinki several times this year.  Despite of this, Linus Torvalds,
author of the word processor Linux with which the SAG was written, is
not worried.  ``We&apos;ll have world domination real soon now, anyway,&apos;&apos; he
explains, ``for 1.4 at the lastest.&apos;&apos;

		<string>Norbert Weiner was the subject of many dotty professor stories.  Weiner was, in
fact, very absent minded.  The following story is told about him: when they
moved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely
useless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since
she was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had
moved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to
him.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He
reached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled
some notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and
threw the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the
old address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they
had moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of
paper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There
was a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where
he had moved to, saying, &quot;Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I&apos;m Norbert Weiner
and we&apos;ve just moved.  Would you know where we&apos;ve moved to?&quot;  To which the
young girl replied, &quot;Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.&quot;
	The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the
story) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn&apos;t
quite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,
however, was pretty close to what actually happened...

stronger.  Sometimes you paint with tiny strokes, a keystroke added here, 
a keystroke changed there.&quot;  She sweeps her arm in a wide arc.  &quot;And other
times you savage whole *blocks* of code, ripping out the program&apos;s very 
*essence*, then beginning anew.  But always building, creating, filling the 
program with your own personal stamp, your own quirks and nuances.  Watching 
the program grow stronger, patching it when it crashes, until finally it can 
stand alone -- proud, powerful, and perfect.  This is the programmer&apos;s finest

		<string>	On the other hand, the TCP camp also has a phrase for OSI people.
There are lots of phrases.  My favorite is `nitwit&apos; -- and the rationale
is the Internet philosophy has always been you have extremely bright,
non-partisan researchers look at a topic, do world-class research, do
several competing implementations, have a bake-off, determine what works
best, write it down and make that the standard.
	The OSI view is entirely opposite.  You take written contributions
from a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room of
committee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and all
with their own political axes to grind, and four years later you get
something out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.
	So the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well,
then write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, write
it down, circulate it a lot and now we&apos;ll see if anyone can implement it
after it&apos;s an international standard and every vendor in the world is
committed to it.  One of those processes is backwards, and I don&apos;t think
it takes a Lucasian professor of physics at Oxford to figure out which.

		<string>	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our support for UNIX?
	Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our
VAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,
easy to get started with. It&apos;s great for students, great for somewhat casual
users, and it&apos;s great for interchanging programs between different machines.
And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run
out of things they can do with UNIX. They&apos;ll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
	With UNIX, if you&apos;re looking for something, you can easily and quickly
check that small manual and find out that it&apos;s not there.  With VMS, no matter
what you look for -- it&apos;s literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if
you look long enough it&apos;s there.  That&apos;s the difference -- the beauty of UNIX
is it&apos;s simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it&apos;s all there.
		-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984

Olsen&apos;s brain.  Ed.]

		<string>Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from two
complementary directions:  to reduce the number of software errors through
rigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of the remaining
errors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnote to this
design is that now a system failure can usually be considered to be the
result of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started the
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the
system.

		<string>	Price Wang&apos;s programmer was coding software.  His fingers danced upon
the keyboard.  The program compiled without an error message, and the program
ran like a gentle wind.
	Excellent!&quot; the Price exclaimed, &quot;Your technique is faultless!&quot;
	&quot;Technique?&quot; said the programmer, turning from his terminal, &quot;What I
follow is the Tao -- beyond all technique.  When I first began to program I
would see before me the whole program in one mass.  After three years I no
longer saw this mass.  Instead, I used subroutines.  But now I see nothing.
My whole being exists in a formless void.  My senses are idle.  My spirit,
free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct.  In short, my program
writes itself.  True, sometimes there are difficult problems.  I see them
coming, I slow down, I watch silently.  Then I change a single line of code
and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the
program.  I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my
eyes for a moment and then log off.&quot;

Title:		Are Frogs Turing Compatible?
Speaker:	Don &quot;The Lion&quot; Knuth

				ABSTRACT
	Several researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying
the computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problem
of frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas
of computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-
bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size
pond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that
there is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program
to a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable
functions.
	This is not just a let&apos;s-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.
This is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.
	Refreshments will be served.  Music will be played.

		<string>	Several students were asked to prove that all odd integers are prime.
	The first student to try to do this was a math student.  &quot;Hmmm...
Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and by induction, we have that all
the odd integers are prime.&quot;
	The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, &quot;I&apos;m not
sure of the validity of your proof, but I think I&apos;ll try to prove it by
experiment.&quot;  He continues, &quot;Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is
prime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13
is prime...  Well, it seems that you&apos;re right.&quot;
	The third student to try it was the engineering student, who responded,
&quot;Well, to be honest, actually, I&apos;m not sure of your answer either.  Let&apos;s
see...  1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...
well, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Well, it
does seem right.&quot;
	Not to be outdone, the computer science student comes along and says
&quot;Well, you two sort&apos;ve got the right idea, but you&apos;ll end up taking too long!
I&apos;ve just whipped up a program to REALLY go and prove it.&quot;  He goes over to
his terminal and runs his program.  Reading the output on the screen he says,
&quot;1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime...&quot;

		<string>***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)

It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge 
in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, 
we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call 
&quot;wisdom engineering&quot;.  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a 
wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  
IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom 
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so 
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic 
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL 
succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed 
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those 
underlying Plato&apos;s theory of government, Kant&apos;s metaphysics, Nietzsche&apos;s theory
of value, and Husserl&apos;s phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe 
IMMANUEL&apos;s achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly 
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

Many of our students have gone on to achieve great success in all fields of
programming.  One former student developed the concept of the personalized

sold a &quot;My Most Unforgettable Program&quot; article to Corrosive Computing magazine.
Another of our graduates writes, &quot;I recently completed a database-management
program for my department manager.  My program touched him so deeply that he
was speechless.  He told me later that he had never seen such a program in
his entire career.  Thank you, Famous Programmers&apos; school; only you could

appropriate to view the host area as a four dimensional hyper-cube, the
four dimensions being cylinder, group, track, and sector.

Referring to our hyper-cube analogy, the set of potentially accessible
blocks form a line parallel to the track axis.  This line moves
parallel to the sector axis, wrapping around when it reaches the edge
of the hyper-cube.

The guy on the right has the Osborne 1, a fully functional computer system

fully loaded, 32-round clips of 125-grain 9mm ammunition.  The owner of the
Uzi is going to get more tactical firepower delivered -- and delivered on
target -- in less time, and with less effort.  All for $795. It&apos;s inevitable.
If you&apos;re going up against some guy with an Osborne 1 -- or any personal 
computer -- he&apos;s the one who&apos;s in trouble.  One round from an Uzi can zip
through ten inches of solid pine wood, so you can imagine what it will do
to structural foam acrylic and sheet aluminum.  In fact, detachable magazines 
for the Uzi are available in 25-, 32-, and 40-round capacities, so you can 
take out an entire office full of Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied
into Ethernet or other local-area networks.  What about the new 16-bit
computers, like the Lisa and Fortune?  Even with the Winchester backup, 
they&apos;re no match for the Uzi.  One quick burst and they&apos;ll find out what

SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot&apos;s Monopurpose Programming Language
Environment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for
Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code
with errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,
END and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can&apos;t make
a syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.  Thus
they achieve the results of programs written in other languages without
the tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.

accomplished with the FOR SURE construct.  A simple example:

	LIKE, Y*KNOW(I MEAN)START
	IF PIZZA	=LIKE BITCHEN AND
	GUY		=LIKE TUBULAR AND
	VALLEY GIRL	=LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2
	THEN
		FOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH*MAYBE 100
			DO*WAH - (DITTY**2); BARF(I)=TOTALLY GROSS(OUT)
		SURE
	LIKE, BAG THIS PROGRAM; REALLY; LIKE TOTALLY(Y*KNOW); IM*SURE
	GOTO THE MALL

	VALGOL is also characterized by its unfriendly error messages.  For
example, when the user makes a syntax error, the interpreter displays the
message GAG ME WITH A SPOON!  A successful compile may be termed MAXIMALLY

DOGO heralds a new era of computer-literate pets.  DOGO commands include

		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #16: C-

This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he
submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is best
described as a &quot;low-level&quot; programming language.  In fact, the language
generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to
execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE

Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely
unstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just are.
Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions. SARTRE
programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH

FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types
refer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and
JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and
BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,
CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.

The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and
financial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include
VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH
and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers
who end up using this language.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #2: RENE

Named after the famous French philosopher and mathematician Rene DesCartes,
RENE is a language used for artificial intelligence.  The language is being
developed at the Chicago Center of Machine Politics and Programming under a
grant from the Jane Byrne Victory Fund.  A spokesman described the language
as &quot;Just as great as dis [sic] city of ours.&quot;

The center is very pleased with progress to date.  They say they have almost
succeeded in getting a VAX to think. However, sources inside the
organization say that each time the machine fails to think it ceases to exist.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #8: LAIDBACK

This language was developed at the Marin County Center for T&apos;ai Chi,
Mellowness and Computer Programming (now defunct), as an alternative to
the more intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.

The center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs while
they worked.  Unfortunately few programmers could survive there because the
center outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and Perrier.

Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle and
non-threatening language since all error messages are in lower case.  For
example, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the message:

	&quot;i hate to bother you, but i just can&apos;t relate to that.  can
	you find the time to try it again?&quot;

master&apos;s office while the master waited in silence.
	&quot;This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,&quot;
began the magician, &quot;ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating
system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user
interfaces.  It took my assistants several hundred man years to construct.
Is it not amazing?&quot;
	The master raised his eyebrows slightly. &quot;It is indeed amazing,&quot; he
said.
	&quot;Corporate Headquarters has commanded,&quot; continued the magician, &quot;that
everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.  Do you agree
to this?&quot;
	&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the master, &quot;I will have it transported to the
data center immediately!&quot;  And the magician returned to his tower, well
pleased.
	Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master
programmer and said, &quot;I cannot find the listing for my new program.  Do

their backpacks off and put them inside.  At which point the salesman turned
to his friend, and said, &quot;You unpack while I go and find us a bear.&quot;
	Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down
on the porch.  Soon he could hear rustling noises in the forest.  The noises
got nearer -- and louder -- and suddenly there was the salesman, running like
hell across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the largest and
most ferocious grizzly bears the analyst had ever seen.
	&quot;Open the door!&quot;, screamed the salesman.
	The analyst whipped open the door, and the salesman ran to the door,
suddenly stopped, and stepped aside.  The bear, unable to stop, continued
through the door and into the cabin.  The salesman slammed the door closed
and grinned at his friend.  &quot;Got him!&quot;, he exclaimed, &quot;now, you skin this

For example, if you wanted all of your &quot;creat()&quot; calls to include read

	I would recommend against this kind of thing in general, since it
hides the changed semantics of &quot;creat()&quot; in a macro, potentially far away
from its uses.
	To allow this use of macros, the preprocessor uses a process that
is worth describing, if for no other reason than that we get to use one of
the more amusing terms introduced into the C lexicon.  While a macro is
being expanded, it is temporarily undefined, and any recurrence of the macro
name is &quot;painted blue&quot; -- I kid you not, this is the official terminology
-- so that in future scans of the text the macro will not be expanded
recursively.  (I do not know why the color blue was chosen; I&apos;m sure it
was the result of a long debate, spread over several meetings.)

curiosity no longer. &quot;Sir Thief,&quot; he said, &quot;I am so perplexed, I cannot live

	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  &quot;Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating
system,&quot; he said.
	&quot;Not so,&quot; said the programmer, &quot;when designing an accounting package,
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design.&quot;

of machinery.  The software is a multi-faceted as a diamond and as convoluted

like a swift-flowing river.  That is why I am happy where I am.&quot;

		<string>Two hundred years ago today, Irma Chine of White Plains, New York, was 
performing her normal housekeeping routines.  She was interrupted by 
British soldiers who, rallying to the call of their supervisor, General
Hughes, sought to gain control of the voter registration lists kept in
her home.  Masking her fear and thinking fast, Mrs. Chine quickly divided
a nearby apple in two and deftly stored the list in its center.  Upon
entering, the British blatantly violated every conceivable convention,
and, though they went through the house virtually bit by bit, their
search was fruitless.  They had to return empty handed.  Word of the
incident propagated rapidly through the region.  This historic event
became the first documented use of core storage for the saving of registers.

		<string>Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. 
to 64 oz.  Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even 
though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. 
Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have 
to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you 
either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been 
drinking Unix Beer for several years.
	BSD stout: Deep, hearty, and an acquired taste.  The official
brewer has released the recipe, and a lot of home-brewers now use it.
	Hurd beer: Long advertised by the popular and politically active
GNU brewery, so far it has more head than body.  The GNU brewery is
mostly known for printing complete brewing instructions on every can,
which contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.
	Linux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his
basement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious
brewers and Unix beer-lovers worldwide, many of whom change the recipe.
	POSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the
newer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.
	Solaris brand: A lager, intended to replace Sun brand stout.
Unlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.
	Sun brand: Long the most popular stout on the Unix market, it was
discontinued in favor of a lager.
	SysV lager: Clear and thirst-quenching, but lacking the body of
stout or the sweetness of ale.

For those of you in the reseller business, here is a helpful tip that will
save your support staff a few hours of precious time.  Before you send your
next machine out to an untrained client, change the permissions on /etc/passwd
to 666 and make sure there is a copy somewhere on the disk.  Now when they
forget the root password, you can easily login as an ordinary user and correct
the damage.  Having a bootable tape (for larger machines) is not a bad idea
either.  If you need some help, give us a call.

		<string>WARNING!!!
This machine is subject to breakdowns during periods of critical need.

A special circuit in the machine called &quot;critical detector&quot; senses the
operator&apos;s emotional state in terms of how desperate he/she is to use the
machine.  The &quot;critical detector&quot; then creates a malfunction proportional
to the desperation of the operator.  Threatening the machine with violence
only aggravates the situation.  Likewise, attempts to use another machine
may cause it to malfunction.  They belong to the same union.  Keep cool
and say nice things to the machine.  Nothing else seems to work.

		<string>&quot;We invented a new protocol and called it Kermit, after Kermit the Frog,
star of &quot;The Muppet Show.&quot; [3]

[3]  Why?  Mostly because there was a Muppets calendar on the wall when we
were trying to think of a name, and Kermit is a pleasant, unassuming sort of
character.  But since we weren&apos;t sure whether it was OK to name our protocol
after this popular television and movie star, we pretended that KERMIT was an
acronym; unfortunately, we could never find a good set of words to go with the
letters, as readers of some of our early source code can attest.  Later, while
looking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed
that &quot;Kermit&quot; was a Celtic word for &quot;free&quot;, which is what all Kermit programs
should be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our
source code (Bill&apos;s baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky
instead).  When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article for
publication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permission
to say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.  Permission
was kindly granted, and now the real story can be told.  I resisted the
temptation, however, to call the present work &quot;Kermit the Book.&quot;

		<string>Welcome to UNIX!  Enjoy your session!  Have a great time!  Note the
use of exclamation points!  They are a very effective method for
demonstrating excitement, and can also spice up an otherwise plain-looking
sentence!  However, there are drawbacks!  Too much unnecessary exclaiming
can lead to a reduction in the effect that an exclamation point has on
the reader!  For example, the sentence

	Jane went to the store to buy bread

should only be ended with an exclamation point if there is something
sensational about her going to the store, for example, if Jane is a
cocker spaniel or if Jane is on a diet that doesn&apos;t allow bread or if
Jane doesn&apos;t exist for some reason!  See how easy it is?!  Proper control
of exclamation points can add new meaning to your life!  Call now to receive

that ever flew, and painted &quot;747&quot; on their tails to make them look as if
they are fast. The flight attendants, of course, attend to your every need,
though the drinks cost $15 a pop. Stupid questions cost $230 per hour,
unless you have SupportLine, which requires a first class ticket and
membership in the frequent flyer club. Then they cost $500, but your
accounting department can call it overhead.

		<string>Writers who use a computer swear to its liberating power in tones that bear
witness to the apocalyptic power of a new divinity.  Their conviction results
from something deeper than mere gratitude for the computer&apos;s conveniences.
Every new medium of writing brings about new intensities of religious belief
and new schisms among believers.  In the 16th century the printed book helped
make possible the split between Catholics and Protestants.  In the 20th
century this history of tragedy and triumph is repeating itself as a farce.
Those who worship the Apple computer and those who put their faith in the IBM
PC are equally convinced that the other camp is damned or deluded.  Each cult
holds in contempt the rituals and the laws of the other.  Each thinks that it
is itself the one hope for salvation.

make the computational equivalent of reading and writing fluent and enjoyable.
As in all the arts, a romance with the material must be well under way.  If
we value the lifelong learning of arts and letters as a springboard for
personal and societal growth, should any less effort be spent to make computing
a part of our lives?&quot;

		<string>At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seemingly
contradictory attitudes -- an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre
or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny
of all ideas, old and new.  This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep
nonsense.  Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to understand the
world, but there is a built-in error-correcting mechanism:  The collective
enterprise of creative thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps the
field on track.

</string>
		<string>One of the saddest lessons of history is this:  If we&apos;ve been bamboozled
long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.  We&apos;re no
longer interested in finding out the truth.  The bamboozle has captured
us.  it is simply too painful to acknowledge -- even to ourselves -- that
we&apos;ve been so credulous.  (So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the
new bamboozles rise.)

		<string>The inability to benefit from feedback appears to be the primary cause of
pseudoscience.  Pseudoscientists retain their beliefs and ignore or distort
contradictory evidence rather than modify or reject a flawed theory.  Because
of their strong biases, they seem to lack the self-correcting mechanisms
scientists must employ in their work.

		<string>Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and
bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and courage.  But if we

serious problems that face us -- and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up
for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along.

		<string>As the system comes up, the component builders will from time to time appear,
bearing hot new versions of their pieces -- faster, smaller, more complete,
or putatively less buggy.  The replacement of a working component by a new
version requires the same systematic testing procedure that adding a new
component does, although it should require less time, for more complete and
efficient test cases will usually be available.
- Frederick Brooks Jr., &quot;The Mythical Man Month&quot; 
</string>
		<string>Each team building another component has been using the most recent tested
version of the integrated system as a test bed for debugging its piece.  Their
work will be set back by having that test bed change under them.  Of course it
must.  But the changes need to be quantized.  Then each user has periods of
productive stability, interrupted by bursts of test-bed change.  This seems
to be much less disruptive than a constant rippling and trembling.

		<string>It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it
is also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organize
the actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.  The manager of
architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were
threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.

The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write
the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more
than the schedule allowed.

The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be 
well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if
the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs
for ten months.

To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program
team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made
the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it
added a year to debugging time.

		<string>The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in contemoprary
psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven fruitful...After
more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist one example of an ESP
phenomenon that is replicable under controlled conditions.  This simple but
basic scientific criterion has not been met despite dozens of studies conducted
over many decades...It is for this reason alone that the topic is now of little
interest to psychology...In short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that
needs explanation.

		<string>Overall, the philosophy is to attack the availability problem from two

rigorous testing of running systems, and to reduce the effect of the
remaining errors by providing for recovery from them.  An interesting footnote

the result of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started the
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the

		<string>I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of
England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only commenced,
I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even the offer
of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men
who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...  

If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express
an opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the 
application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

		<string>I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It&apos;s a
very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroom
everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, or
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,
and it&apos;s not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor
popularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.

		<string>If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessible
and exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kind
of Gresham&apos;s Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out the
good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community
ourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, the
media, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper
in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly
astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational
system.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure that
may even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the human
future.

		<string>The characteristic property of hallucinogens, to suspend the boundaries between
the experiencing self and the outer world in an ecstatic, emotional experience,
makes it posible with their help, and after suitable internal and external
perparation...to evoke a mystical experience according to plan, so to speak...
I see the true importance of LSD in the possibility of providing materail aid 
to meditation aimed at the mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive
reality.  Such a use accords entirely with the essence and working character
of LSD as a sacred drug.

		<string>I share the belief of many of my contemporaries that the spiritual crisis
pervading all spheres of Western industrial society can be remedied only 
by a change in our world view.  We shall have to shift from the materialistic,
dualistic belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a
new conciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces the 
experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their oneness with animate 
nature and all of creation.
- Dr. Albert Hoffman
</string>
		<string>Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and related
hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entails
dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take into
account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The history
of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that can
ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken
for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preperations
are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful
experience.

There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between 
prejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you have
looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice
is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious
mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can&apos;t be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

strongly.  I sincerely believe that the space program, with its manned
landing on the moon, if wisely executed, will become the spearhead for a
broad front of courageous and energetic activities in all the fields of
endeavour of the human mind - activities which could not be carried out

		<string>The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only
opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts
at rational thinking.  Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of
knowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable.  Since the earliest
days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
effort to liberate the body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and
everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
laws, bad social theories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an
apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.

		<string>The notion that science does not concern itself with first causes -- that it
leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere

every reason to believe that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow.

		<string>The evidence of the emotions, save in cases where it has strong objective

Thus the familiar argument that there is an instinctive desire for immortality,
and that this desire proves it to be a fact, becomes puerile when it is
recalled that there is also a powerful and widespread fear of annihilation,
and that this fear, on the same principle proves that there is nothing
beyond the grave.  Such childish &quot;proofs&quot; are typically theological, and
they remain theological even when they are adduced by men who like to

years old and its living creatures are linked by ties of evolutionary
descent.  Scientists stand accused of promoting dogma by so stating, but
do we brand people illiberal when they proclaim that the earth is neither
flat nor at the center of the universe?  Science *has* taught us some
things with confidence!  Evolution on an ancient earth is as well
established as our planet&apos;s shape and position.  Our continuing struggle
to understand how evolution happens (the &quot;theory of evolution&quot;) does not

is a working assumption only....It is quite conceivable that someday the
assumption will have to be rejected.  But it is important also to see that we
have not reached that day yet: the working assumption is a necessary one and
there is no real evidence opposed to it.  Our failure to solve a problem so
far does not make it insoluble.  One cannot logically be a determinist in

		<string>The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events, the firmer
becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered
regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him neither the rule of
human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural
events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural
events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this
doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge
has not yet been able to set foot.

But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives
of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine which 
is able to maintain itself not in clear light, but only in the dark, will
of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human
progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion
must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, 
give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast
powers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail
themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the 
True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a more
difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious

		<string>...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their 
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
are frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.

has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The 
problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and 
irrational -- the powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in 
changing the believer&apos;s mind.

proposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,
the Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and
they themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and

		<string>Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered 
samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to 
common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
any such &quot;show-down&quot; is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; 
authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary 
ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The &quot;religious&quot;
would be the last to be willing that either the history of the
content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those
to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any other spirit.

psychokinesis, reincarnation, and so on, I am frequently challenged with
the most popular of all neuro-mythologies -- the notion that we ordinarily
use only 10 percent of our brains...

This &quot;cerebral spare tire&quot; concept continues to nourish the clientele of
&quot;pop psychologists&quot; and their many recycling self-improvement schemes.  As
a metaphor for the fact that few of us fully exploit our talents, who could
deny it?  As a refuge for occultists seeking a neural basis of the miraculous,
it leaves much to be desired.

		<string>The language provides a programmer with a set of conceptual tools; if these are
inadequate for the task, they will simply be ignored.  For example, seriously
restricting the concept of a pointer simply forces the programmer to use a
vector plus integer arithmetic to implement structures, pointer, etc.  Good
design and the absence of errors cannot be guaranteed by mere language
features.

		<string>While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of possession,
conversion, revelation, or divine ecstasy was merely an epileptic discharge,
we must ask how one differentiates &quot;real transcendence&quot; from neuropathies
that produce the same extreme realness, profundity, ineffability, and sense
of cosmic unity.  When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs
[temporal-lobe epileptics] are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations of
the religious tradition, the parallels are striking.  The same is true of the
recent spate of alleged UFO abductees.  Parsimony alone argues against invoking
spirits, demons, or extraterrestrials when natural causes will suffice.

		<string>Two things are certain about science.  It does not stand still for long,
and it is never boring.  Oh, among some poor souls, including even
intellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequently
misperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from
on high in must, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of unchanging
precepts defended with authoritarian vigor.  Others view it as nothing
but a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific
method: hidebound, linear, and left brained.

These people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  They are
destined to view the world of science with a set of blinders.  They
know nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and 
tendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the 
creativity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And they are likely to
know little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveries
that every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of the
natural world.

		<string>I did cancel one performance in Holland where they thought my music was so easy
that they didn&apos;t rehearse at all.  And so the first time when I found that out,
I rehearsed the orchestra myself in front of the audience of 3,000 people and
the next day I rehearsed through the second movement -- this was the piece
_Cheap Imitation_ -- and they then were ashamed.  The Dutch people were ashamed
and they invited me to come to the Holland festival and they promised to
rehearse.  And when I got to Amsterdam they had changed the orchestra, and
again, they hadn&apos;t rehearsed.  So they were no more prepared the second time
than they had been the first.  I gave them a lecture and told them to cancel
the performance; they then said over the radio that i had insisted on their
cancelling the performance because they were &quot;insufficiently Zen.&quot;

		<string>Inadmissible:  Not competent to be considered.  Said of certain kinds of
testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with,
and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves
alone.  Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was
unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous 
actions, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, are
daily undertaken on hearsay evidence.  There is no religion in the world
that has any other basis than hearsay evidence.  Revelation is hearsay
evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the
testimony of men long dead whose identy is not clearly established and
who are not known to have been sworn in any sense.  Under the rules of
evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law...

But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be proved
that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to
mankind.  The evidence (including confession) upon which certain women
were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still
unimpeachable.  The judges&apos; decisions based on it were sound in logic and
in law.  Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than
the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death.
If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are alike
destitute of value.  --Ambrose Bierce

		<string>&quot;...I could accept this openness, glasnost, perestroika, or whatever you want
to call it if they did these things: abolish the one party system; open the
Soviet frontier and allow Soviet people to travel freely; allow the Soviet
people to have real free enterprise; allow Western businessmen to do business
there, and permit freedom of speech and of the press.  But so far, the whole
country is like a concentration camp.  The barbed wire on the fence around
the Soviet Union is to keep people inside, in the dark.  This openness that
you are seeing, all these changes, are cosmetic and they have been designed
to impress shortsighted, naive, sometimes stupid Western leaders.  These
leaders gush over Gorbachev, hoping to do business with the Soviet Union or
appease it.  He will say: &quot;Yes, we can do business!&quot;  This while his
military machine in Afghanistan has killed over a million people out of a
population of 17 million.  Can you imagine that?

		<string>&quot;If you want the best things to happen in corporate life you have to find ways
to be hospitable to the unusual person.  You don&apos;t get innovation as a

Certainly you get it as an anthitetical process, so you have to have an
environment where the body of people are really amenable to change and can

</string>
		<string>&quot;In corporate life, I think there are three important areas which contracts
can&apos;t deal with, the area of conflict, the area of change and area of reaching
potential.  To me a covenant is a relationship that is based on such things
as shared ideals and shared value systems and shared ideas and shared
agreement as to the processes we are going to use for working together.  In
many cases they develop into real love relationships.&quot;
-- Max DePree, chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc., &quot;Herman Miller&apos;s 
   Secrets of Corporate Creativity&quot;, The Wall Street Journal, May 3, 1988
</string>
		<string>Another goal is to establish a relationship &quot;in which it is OK for everybody
to do their best.  There are an awful lot of people in management who really
don&apos;t want subordinates to do their best, because it gets to be very
threatening.  But we have found that both internally and with outside
designers if we are willing to have this kind of relationship and if we&apos;re
willing to be vulnerable to what will come out of it, we get really good
work.&quot;

		<string>In his book, Mr. DePree tells the story of how designer George Nelson urged
that the company also take on Charles Eames in the late 1940s.  Max&apos;s father,
J. DePree, co-founder of the company with herman Miller in 1923, asked Mr.
Nelson if he really wanted to share the limited opportunities of a then-small
company with another designer.  &quot;George&apos;s response was something like this:
&apos;Charles Eames is an unusual talent.  He is very different from me.  The
company needs us both.  I want very much to have Charles Eames share in
whatever potential there is.&apos;&quot;

</string>
		<string>Mr. DePree believes participative capitalism is the wave of the future.  The
U.S. work force, he believes, &quot;more and more demands to be included in the
capitalist system and if we don&apos;t find ways to get the capitalist system
to be an inclusive system rather than the exclusive system it has been, we&apos;re
all in deep trouble.  If we don&apos;t find ways to begin to understand that 
capitalism&apos;s highest potential lies in the common good, not in the individual
good, then we&apos;re risking the system itself.&quot;

</string>
		<string>Mr. DePree also expects a &quot;tremendous social change&quot; in all workplaces.  &quot;When
I first started working 40 years ago, a factory supervisor was focused on the
product.  Today it is drastically different, because of the social milieu.
It isn&apos;t unusual for a worker to arrive on his shift and have some family
problem that he doesn&apos;t know how to resolve.  The example I like to use is a
guy who comes in and says &apos;this isn&apos;t going to be a good day for me, my son
is in jail on a drunk-driving charge and I don&apos;t know how to raise bail.&apos;
What that means is that if the supervisor wants productivity, he has to know
how to raise bail.&quot;

		<string>&quot;The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth.&quot;  I usually pick one small
topic like this to give a lecture on.  Poets say science takes away from the
beauty of the stars -- mere gobs of gas atoms.  Nothing is &quot;mere.&quot;  I too can
see the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more?
The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination -- stuck on this carousel
my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.  A vast pattern -- of which
I am a part -- perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one
is belching there.  Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together.
What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?*  It does not do harm to the 
mystery to know a little about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth than
any artists of the past imagined!  Why do the poets of the present not speak
of it?  What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but
if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?

		<string>&quot;Pseudocode can be used to some extent to aid the maintenance
process.  However, pseudocode that is highly detailed -
approaching the level of detail of the code itself - is not of
much use as maintenance documentation.  Such detailed
documentation has to be maintained almost as much as the code,
thus doubling the maintenance burden.  Furthermore, since such
voluminous pseudocode is too distracting to be kept in the
listing itself, it must be kept in a separate folder.  The
result: Since pseudocode - unlike real code - doesn&apos;t have to be
maintained, no one will maintain it.  It will soon become out of
date and everyone will ignore it.  (Once, I did an informal
survey of 42 shops that used pseudocode.  Of those 42, 0 [zero!],
found that it had any value as maintenance documentation.&quot;

		<string>An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented creature, doomed to create new problems for himself for the
duration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse nor the chimp
knows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow this
discovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, speculation and truth-seeking that has goaded him through the
centures as reelentlessly as hunger or sexual longing.  The chimp that does
not know that he exists is not driven to discover his origins and is spared
the tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animal 
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bananas or 
to play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no 
appreciation of beauty, for the greatest part of man&apos;s wisdom may be traced
back to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

		<string>    UNIX Shell is the Best Fourth Generation Programming Language

    It is the UNIX shell that makes it possible to do applications in a small 
    fraction of the code and time it takes in third generation languages.  In 
    the shell you process whole files at a time, instead of only a line at a 
    time.  And, a line of code in the UNIX shell is one or more programs,
    which do more than pages of instructions in a 3GL.  Applications can be
    developed in hours and days, rather than months and years with traditional
    systems.  Most of the other 4GLs available today look more like COBOL or
    RPG, the most tedious of the third generation lanaguages.

		<string>&quot;A commercial, and in some respects a social, doubt has been started within the
 last year or two, whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security
 or insecurity of locks.  Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discus-
 sion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a
 premium for dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest.  This is a fal-
 lacy.  Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much more
 than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.  Rogues knew
 a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among them-
 selves, as they have lately done.  If a lock -- let it have been made in what-
 ever country, or by whatever maker -- is not so inviolable as it has hitherto
 been deemed to be, surely it is in the interest of *honest* persons to know
 this fact, because the *dishonest* are tolerably certain to be the first to
 apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of knowledge is necessary to
 give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.  It cannot be too ear-
 nestly urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better
 for all parties.&quot;

		<string> In respect to lock-making, there can scarcely be such a thing as dishonesty 
 of intention: the inventor produces a lock which he honestly thinks will 
 possess such and such qualities; and he declares his belief to the world.
 If others differ from him in opinion concerning those qualities, it is open
 to them to say so; and the discussion, truthfully conducted, must lead to
 public advantage: the discussion stimulates curiosity, and curiosity stimu-
 lates invention.  Nothing but a partial and limited view of the question
 could lead to the opinion that harm can result: if there be harm, it will be
 much more than counterbalanced by good.&quot;

the further premise that there are no propositions that are not
open to doubt; it is enough, even if there are, that in the end it is
worse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.  Hence it
has been again and again unconditionally proclaimed that there are
no limits to the privilege so far as words seek to affect only the hearers&apos;
beliefs and not their conduct.  The trouble is that conduct is almost
always based upon some belief, and that to change the hearer&apos;s belief
will generally to some extent change his conduct, and may even evoke
conduct that the law forbids.

New York is a jungle.  New York *is a jungle.*  Beneath the columns of
the old rain forest, made of melting macadam, the mean Limpopo of swamped 
Ninth Avenue bears an angry argosy of crocs and dragons, tiger fish, noise
machines, sweating rainmakers.  On the corners stand witchdoctors and
headhunters, babbling voodoo-men -- the natives, the jungle-smart natives.
And at night, under the equatorial overgrowth and heat-holding cloud
cover, you hear the ragged parrot-hoot and monkeysqueak of the sirens,
and then fires flower to ward off monsters.  Careful: the streets are
sprung with pits and nets and traps.  Hire a guide.  Pack your snakebite
gook and your blowdart serum.  Take it seriously.  You have to get a
bit jungle-wise.

		<string>Now I was heading, in my hot cage, down towards meat-market country on the
tip of the West Village.  Here the redbrick warehouses double as carcass
galleries and rat hives, the Manhattan fauna seeking its necessary
level, living or dead.  Here too you find the heavy faggot hangouts,
The Spike, the Water Closet, the Mother Load.  Nobody knows what goes on
in these places.  Only the heavy faggots know.  Even Fielding seems somewhat 
vague on the question.  You get zapped and flogged and dumped on -- by
almost anybody&apos;s standards, you have a really terrible time.  The average
patron arrives at the Spike in one taxi but needs to go back to his sock
in two.  And then the next night he shows up for more.  They shackle 
themselves to racks, they bask in urinals.  Their folks have a lot of
explaining to do, if you want my opinion, particularly the mums.  Sorry
to single you ladies out like this but the story must start somewhere.  
A craving for hourly murder -- it can&apos;t be willed.  In the meantime,
Fielding tells me, Mother Nature looks on and taps her foot and clicks
her tongue.  Always a champion of monogamy, she is cooking up some fancy
new diseases.  She just isn&apos;t going to stand for it.

   excerpts from a discussion on Astrology and Reagan
</string>
		<string>The reported resort to astrology in the White House has occasioned much
merriment.  It is not funny.  Astrological gibberish, which means astrology
generally, has no place in a newspaper, let alone government.  Unlike comics,
which are part of a newspaper&apos;s harmless pleasure and make no truth claims,
astrology is a fraud.  The idea that it gets a hearing in government is
dismaying.

		<string>Astrology is the sheerest hokum.  This pseudoscience has been around since
the day of the Chaldeans and Babylonians.  It is as phony as numerology,
phrenology, palmistry, alchemy, the reading of tea leaves, and the practice
of divination by the entrails of a goat.  No serious person will buy the
notion that our lives are influenced individually by the movement of
distant planets.  This is the sawdust blarney of the carnival midway.
-- James J. Kilpatrick, Universal Press Syndicate
</string>
		<string>A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believer
in the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughter
is that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward
science.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we&apos;ve all come to
accept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not
that long ago, it was Reagan&apos;s support of Creationism....Creationists actually
got equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded
to the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were
scientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president
is averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American
turf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns
into a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.  The same
people who doubt experts can also believe any quackery, from the benefits of
laetrile to eye of newt to the movment of planets.  We lose the capacity to
make rational -- scientific -- judgments.  It&apos;s all the same.
-- Ellen Goodman, The Boston Globe Newspaper Company-Washington Post Writers 
    Group
</string>
		<string>The spectacle of astrology in the White House -- the governing center of
the world&apos;s greatest scientific and military power -- is so appalling that
it defies understanding and provides grounds for great fright.  The easiest
response is to laugh it off, and to indulge in wisecracks about Civil
Service ratings for horoscope makers and palm readers and whether Reagan
asked Mikhail Gorbachev for his sign.  A contagious good cheer is the
hallmark of this presidency, even when the most dismal matters are concerned.
But this time, it isn&apos;t funny.  It&apos;s plain scary.

   &quot;Newsday&quot;, May 5, 1988

		<string>[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this
belief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We&apos;re dealing with
beliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There&apos;s nothing there....
It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It&apos;s got technical
terms.  It&apos;s got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite
glib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from
metaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The
fact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that
should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They
have not proved their case....It&apos;s just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there&apos;s
no theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It&apos;s been tested
and tested over the centuries.  Nobody&apos;s ever found any validity to it at
all.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it
has to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --
you test it.  And in that astrology is reqlly quite something else.
-- Astronomer Richard Berendzen, President, American University, on ABC
    News &quot;Nightline,&quot; May 3, 1988
</string>
		<string>Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,
what sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
generously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.

		<string>With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning
her husband&apos;s schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles
on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations
of a well-established &quot;anti-science&quot; tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could threaten the country&apos;s position as a technological power. . . .  The
manifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series
of quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur
well for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a 
significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance
of and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of
maintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not
suffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.

insure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the
destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be,
be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to
insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as 
your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be
yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your
receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this
thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.&quot;

		<string>	Well, punk is kind of anti-ethical, anyway.  Its ethics, so to speak,
include a disdain for ethics in general.  If you have to think about some-
thing so hard, then it&apos;s bullshit anyway; that&apos;s the idea.  Punks are anti-
ismists, to coin a term.  But nonetheless, they have a pretty clearly defined

		<string>	I think for the most part that the readership here uses the c-word in
a similar fashion.  I don&apos;t think anybody really believes in a new, revolution-
ary literature --- I think they use `cyberpunk&apos; as a term of convenience to
discuss the common stylistic elements in a small subset of recent sf books.
-- Jeff G. Bone
</string>
		<string>	So we get to my point.  Surely people around here read things that
aren&apos;t on the *Officially Sanctioned Cyberpunk Reading List*.  Surely we
don&apos;t (any of us) really believe that there is some big, deep political and
philosophical message in all this, do we?  So if this `cyberpunk&apos; thing is
just a term of convenience, how can somebody sell out?  If cyberpunk is just a
word we use to describe a particular style and imagery in sf, how can it be
dead?  Where are the profound statements that the `Movement&apos; is or was trying
to make?
	I think most of us are interested in examining and discussing literary
(and musical) works that possess a certain stylistic excellence and perhaps a
rather extreme perspective; this is what CP is all about, no?  Maybe there 
should be a newsgroup like, say, alt.postmodern or somthing.  Something less
restrictive in scope than alt.cyberpunk.

work being done at the MIT Media Lab.  It was meant as a haven for
people with vision of this scope.  If you want to create a haven for
people with narrower visions, feel free.  But I feel sad for anyone

2) For a negotiated price (same arrangement) the TETflame programme
   is offering ``flame insurence&apos;&apos;. Under this arrangement, if
   one of our policy holders is flamed, we will cancel the offending
   article and flame the flamer, to a crisp.

3) The TETflame flaming representatives include: Richard Sexton, Oleg
   Kisalev, Diane Holt, Trish O&apos;Tauma, Dave Hill, Greg Nowak and our most
   recent aquisition, Keith Doyle. But all he will do is put you in his
   kill file. Weemba by special arrangement.

		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 1

proof by example:
	The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it 
	contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

proof by intimidation:
	&apos;Trivial&apos;.

proof by vigorous handwaving:
	Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 2

proof by cumbersome notation:
	Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
	symbols.

proof by exhaustion:
	An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.

proof by omission:
	&apos;The reader may easily supply the details&apos;
	&apos;The other 253 cases are analogous&apos;
	&apos;...&apos; 

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 3

proof by obfuscation:
	A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless 
	syntactically related statements.

proof by wishful citation:
	The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of 
	a theorem from the literature to support his claims.

proof by funding:
	How could three different government agencies be wrong?

proof by eminent authority:
	&apos;I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
	complete.&apos; 

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 4

proof by personal communication:
	&apos;Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete 
	[Karp, personal communication].&apos; 

proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
	&apos;To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is 
	decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.&apos; 

proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
	The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found 
	in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian 
	Philological Society, 1883.

proof by importance:
	A large body of useful consequences all follow from the 
	proposition in question.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 5

proof by accumulated evidence:
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.

proof by metaproof:
	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The 
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these 
	techniques.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 6

proof by picture:
	A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well 
	with proof by omission.

proof by vehement assertion:
	It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the 
	audience.

proof by ghost reference:
	Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in 
	the reference given.

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 7
proof by forward reference:
	Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, 
	which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

proof by semantic shift:
	Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed 
	for the statement of the result.

proof by appeal to intuition:
	Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.

Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a
big trade!  Since it&apos;s a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy
as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try
news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.

The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.  He is
a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also
interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to
soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn&apos;t exist, so cross-post to
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as
well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles
there, and a &quot;comp&quot; group will propagate your article further.)

You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each group.
If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders will
only show the the article to the reader once!  Don&apos;t tolerate this.

		<string>Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to do?

A: Don&apos;t worry about how your articles look.  Remember it&apos;s the message
that counts, not the way it&apos;s presented.  Ignore the fact that sloppy
spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent messages that
soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.

		<string>Q: They just announced on the radio that Dan Quayle was picked as the

A: Of course.  The net can reach people in as few as 3 to 5 days.  It&apos;s
the perfect way to inform people about such news events long after the
broadcast networks have covered them.  As you are probably the only person
to have heard the news on the radio, be sure to post as soon as you can.

		<string>		     THE &quot;FUN WITH USENET&quot; MANIFESTO
Very little happens on Usenet without some sort of response from some other 
reader.  Fun With Usenet postings are no exception.  Since there are some who 
might question the rationale of some of the excerpts included therein, I have 
written up a list of guidelines that sum up the philosophy behind these 
postings.

	One.  I never cut out words in the middle of a quote without a VERY 
good reason, and I never cut them out without including ellipses.  For 
instance, &quot;I am not a goob&quot; might become &quot;I am ... a goob&quot;, but that&apos;s too 
mundane to bother with.  &quot;I&apos;m flame proof&quot; might (and has) become 
&quot;I&apos;m ...a... p...oof&quot; but that&apos;s REALLY stretching it.

	Two.  If I cut words off the beginning or end of a quote, I don&apos;t
put ellipses, but neither do I capitalize something that wasn&apos;t capitalized
before the cut. &quot;I don&apos;t think that the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful
place&quot; would turn into &quot;the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful place&quot;.  Imagine
the posting as a tape-recording of the poster&apos;s thoughts.  If I can set
up the quote via fast-forwarding and stopping the tape, and without splicing,
I don&apos;t put ellipses in.  And by the way, I love using this mechanism for
turning things around.  If you think something stinks, say so - don&apos;t say you
don&apos;t think it&apos;s wonderful.   ...

		<string>I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of 
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use 
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, 
such as &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I 
conceive&quot;, &quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it 
appears to me at present&quot;.

When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the 
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some 
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in 
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.

I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I 
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my 
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had 
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily 
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I 
happened to be in the right.

		<string>One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn&apos;t
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn&apos;t understand
hat was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was reknowned for 
being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the time, which
obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be puzzled
rather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

finally find and enter the Promised Land.  With him, he brought his
favorite robot, faithful old Yewtoo Artoo, to carry his gear and do
assorted camp chores.

as the months passed, became very fond of him.  Patriarchs took to
discussing abtruse theological problems with him, and each evening the
children all gathered to hear the many stories with which he was programmed.
Therefore it came as a great shock to them when, just as their journey was
ending, he abruptly wore out.  Even Feghoot couldn&apos;t console them.

		<string>After this was written there appeared a remarkable posthumous memoir that
throws some doubt on Millikan&apos;s leading role in these experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago,
at Millikan&apos;s suggestion worked on the measurement of electronic charge for
his doctoral thesis, and co-authored some of the early papers on this subject
with Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript with a friend with instructions
that it be published after his death; the manuscript was published in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims that he was the
first to do the experiment with oil drops, was the first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been the first to suggest the use of oil.
According to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-authored with Millikan on
the crucial first article announcing the measurement of the electronic
charge, but was talked out of this by Millikan.

Robert Millikan is generally credited with making the first really
precise measurement of the charge on an electron and was awarded the

		<string>	An architect&apos;s first work is apt to be spare and clean.  He knows

	As he designs the first work, frill after frill and embellishment
after embellishment occur to him.  These get stored away to be used &quot;next
time.&quot; Sooner or later the first system is finished, and the architect,
with firm confidence and a demonstrated mastery of that class of systems,
is ready to build a second system.
	This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.
When he does his third and later ones, his prior experiences will
confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems,
and their differences will identify those parts of his experience that
are particular and not generalizable.
	The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using

that would describe a quantity that would dwindle and dwindle, but never
quite reach zero.  Historically, he was merely trying to work out his
mortgage.  Another versatile equation also emerged, one which would define
a function that would continue to grow, but never reach unity.  This equation
can be applied to charging capacitors, over-damped springs, and the human
race in general.

The five main kinds of electricity are alternating current, direct current,

current, which means that the electricity goes in one direction for a while,
then goes in the other direction.  This prevents harmful electron buildup in

		<string>Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your
hand into a friend&apos;s mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.  Did you
notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?  This
teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never
use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.
	It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.  When you scuffed
your feet, you picked up batches of &quot;electrons&quot;, which are very small objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.
The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,
where they form a spark that leaps to your friend&apos;s filling, then travels
down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.
	Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger
would explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you have
carpeting.

	&quot;Now, what affects it?&quot;
	&quot;Ah!&quot; said old Yacob.
	&quot;This,&quot; said the doctor, answering his own question.  &quot;Those queer
things that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable soft
depression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Bogota, in such a way
as to affect his brain.  They are greatly distended, he has eyelashes, and
his eyelids move, and cosequently his brain is in a state of constant
irritation and distraction.&quot;
	&quot;Yes?&quot; said old Yacob.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
	&quot;And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order
to cure him completely, all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical
operation -- namely, to remove those irritant bodies.&quot;
	&quot;And then he will be sane?&quot;
	&quot;Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable citizen.&quot;

		<string>I myself have dreamed up a structure intermediate between Dyson spheres
and planets.  Build a ring 93 million miles in radius -- one Earth orbit
-- around the sun.  If we have the mass of Jupiter to work with, and if
we make it a thousand miles wide, we get a thickness of about a thousand
feet for the base.

And it has advantages.  The Ringworld will be much sturdier than a Dyson
sphere.  We can spin it on its axis for gravity.  A rotation speed of 770
m/s will give us a gravity of one Earth normal.  We wouldn&apos;t even need to
roof it over.  Place walls one thousand miles high at each edge, facing the
sun.  Very little air will leak over the edges.

Lord knows the thing is roomy enough.  With three million times the surface
area of the Earth, it will be some time before anyone complains of the
crowding.

into the blueness, and I think as you go farther and farther away from
the reflected light we have from the sun or the light that&apos;s bouncing
off this earth, uh, the darker it gets ... I think if you look at the
color scale, you start at black, move it through purple, move it on
out, it&apos;s the shifting of color.  We mentioned before about the stars
singing, and that&apos;s one of the effects of the shifting of colors.&quot;

as the eye could see.  So they set out in building a Mathematical edifice that
was to reach up as far as &quot;up&quot; went.  Further and further up they went ...
until one night the edifice collapsed under the weight of paradox.
	The following morning saw only rubble where there once was a huge
structure reaching to the heavens.  One by one, the Mathematicians climbed
out from under the rubble.  It was a miracle that nobody was killed; but when
they began to speak to one another, SUPRISE of all suprises! they could not
understand each other.  They all spoke different languages.  They all fought
amongst themselves and each went about their own way.  To this day the
Topologists remain the original Mathematicians.

		<string>In the course of reading Hadamard&apos;s &quot;The Psychology of Invention in the

which we coffee achievers have long appreciated:  no really creative,
intelligent thought is possible without a good cup of coffee.  On page
14, Hadamard is discussing Poincare&apos;s theory of fuchsian groups and
fuchsian functions, which he describes as &quot;... one of his greatest
discoveries, the first which consecrated his glory ...&quot;  Hadamard refers
to Poincare having had a &quot;... sleepless night which initiated all that
memorable work ...&quot; and gives the following, very revealing quote:

	&quot;One evening, contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and
	could not sleep.  Ideas rose in crowds;  I felt them collide
	until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable
	combination.&quot;

could really have amounted to something as a coffee achiever.

thing that could have wings&quot;, for perhaps it can only be that Walter&apos;s
horse has wings by Walter having a different horse.  Nor does &quot;Walter&apos;s

		<string>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty --
a beauty cold and austere, like that of a sculpture, without appeal to any

greatest art can show.  The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense
of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is
to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.

		<string>Modern psychology takes completely for granted that behavior and neural
function are perfectly correlated, that one is completely caused by the
other.  There is no separate soul or lifeforce to stick a finger into the
brain now and then and make neural cells do what they would not otherwise.
Actually, of course, this is a working assumption only. ... It is quite
conceivable that someday the assumption will have to be rejected.  But it
is important also to see that we have not reached that day yet: the working
assumption is a necessary one and there is no real evidence opposed to it.
Our failure to solve a problem so far does not make it insoluble.  One cannot

</string>
		<string>	My message is not that biological determinists were bad scientists or
even that they were always wrong.  Rather, I believe that science must be
understood as a social phenomenon, a gutsy, human enterprise, not the work of
robots programmed to collect pure information.  I also present this view as
an upbeat for science, not as a gloomy epitaph for a noble hope sacrificed on
the alter of human limitations.
	I believe that a factual reality exists and that science, though often
in an obtuse and erratic manner, can learn about it.  Galileo was not shown
the instruments of torture in an abstract debate about lunar motion.  He had
threatened the Church&apos;s conventional argument for social and doctrinal
stability:  the static world order with planets circling about a central
earth, priests subordinate to the Pope and serfs to their lord.  But the
Church soon made its peace with Galileo&apos;s cosmology.  They had no choice; the
earth really does revolve about the sun.

		-- Wolfgang Pauli
</string>
		<string>Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group of
us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names of the
smaller prime numbers.

2:  The Odd Prime --
	It&apos;s the only even prime, therefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime --
	Lewis Carroll: &quot;If I tell you 3 times, it&apos;s true.&quot;
31: The Arbitrary Prime --
	Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary prime in
	case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.  91 received
	the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the next most.
	However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none at all.
41: The Female Prime --
	The polynomial X**2 - X + 41 is
	prime for integer values from 1 to 40.
43: The Male Prime - they form a prime pair.

Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities
are derived from those primes.  So, for instance, the number 6 is &quot;odd
but true&quot;, while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.

		<string>One day this guy is finally fed up with his middle-class existence and
decides to do something about it.  He calls up his best friend, who is a
mathematical genius.  &quot;Look,&quot; he says, &quot;do you suppose you could find some
way mathematically of guaranteeing winning at the race track?  We could
make a lot of money and retire and enjoy life.&quot;  The mathematician thinks
this over a bit and walks away mumbling to himself.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask the genius if he&apos;s had any
success.  The genius, looking a little bleary-eyed, replies, &quot;Well, yes,
actually I do have an idea, and I&apos;m reasonably sure that it will work, but
there a number of details to be figured out.
	After the second week the mathematician appears at his friend&apos;s house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, &quot;I think I&apos;ve got it! I still have
some of the theory to work out, but now I&apos;m certain that I&apos;m on the right
track.&quot;
	At the end of the third week the mathematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his door at three in the morning.  He has dark circles under his
eyes.  His hair hasn&apos;t been combed for many days.  He appears to be wearing
the same clothes as the last time.  He has several pencils sticking out from
behind his ears and an almost maniacal expression on his face.  &quot;WE CAN DO

		<string>Oxygen is a very toxic gas and an extreme fire hazard.  It is fatal in
concentrations of as little as 0.000001 p.p.m.  Humans exposed to the
oxygen concentrations die within a few minutes.  Symptoms resemble very
much those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher
concentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it
takes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason
for the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of
oxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex
process called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is
always fatal.

However, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the
fact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is
sufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any
considerable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with
symptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.

Oxygen is an extreme fire hazard.  All of the fires that were reported in
the continental U.S. for the period of the past 25 years were found to be
due to the presence of this gas in the atmosphere surrounding the buildings
in question.

Oxygen is especially dangerous because it is odorless, colorless and
tasteless, so that its presence can not be readily detected until it is
too late.

		<string>The astronomer Francesco Sizi, a contemporary of Galileo, argues that
Jupiter can have no satellites:

From which and many other similar phenomena of nature such as the seven
metals, etc., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather that the number
of planets is necessarily seven. [...]

therefore can have no influence on the earth and therefore would be useless

	be opened and thusly tagged, that thy days may be long in this
	earthly vale of tears.
(3)	Prove to thyself that all circuits that radiateth, and upon
	which the worketh, are grounded and thusly tagged lest they lift
	thee to a radio frequency potential and causeth thee to make like
	a radiator too.

(5)	Take care that thou useth the proper method when thou takest the

	property number and can be easily surveyed, the test meter has
	one and, as a consequence, bringeth much woe unto a purchasing agent.
(6)	Take care that thou tamperest not with interlocks and safety devices,
	for this incurreth the wrath of the chief electrician and bring
	the fury of the engineers on his head.
(7)	Work thou not on energized equipment for if thou doest so, thy
	friends will surely be buying beers for thy widow and consoling
	her in certain ways not generally acceptable to thee.
(8)	Verily, verily I say unto thee, never service equipment alone,
	for electrical cooking is a slow process and thou might sizzle in
	thy own fat upon a hot circuit for hours on end before thy maker
	sees fit to end thy misery and drag thee into his fold.

	The man officially credited with inventing the vacuum cleaner is

invented it.  
	In 1901 Booth visited a London music-hall.  On the bill was an
American inventor with his wonder machine for removing dust from carpets.
	The machine comprised a box about one foot square with a bag on top.
After watching the act -- which made everyone in the front six rows sneeze
-- Booth went round to the inventor&apos;s dressing room.
	&quot;It should suck not blow,&quot; said Booth, coming straight to the
point.  &quot;Suck?&quot;, exclaimed the enraged inventor.  &quot;Your machine just moves
the dust around the room,&quot; Booth informed him.  &quot;Suck?  Suck?  Sucking is
not possible,&quot; was the inventor&apos;s reply and he stormed out.  Booth proved
that it was by the simple expedient of kneeling down, pursing his lips and
sucking the back of an armchair.  &quot;I almost choked,&quot; he said afterwards.

as the light of seven days.&quot;  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times
as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature
of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where
the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,
i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using
the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute
temperature of the earth (~300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact
temperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the
temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revelations 21:8 says &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.&quot;  A lake of molten
brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point,
or 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)  We have,
then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

call for help in this canyon and the echo will carry our voices to the
end of the canyon.  Someone&apos;s bound to hear us by then!&quot;
	So he leans over the basket and screams out, &quot;Helllloooooo!  Where
are we?&quot;  (They hear the echo several times).
	Fifteen minutes later, they hear this echoing voice: &quot;Helllloooooo!
You&apos;re lost!&quot;
	The shouter comments, &quot;That must have been a mathematician.&quot;
	Puzzled, his friend asks, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;
	&quot;For three reasons.  First, he took a long time to answer, second,
he was absolutely correct, and, third, his answer was absolutely useless.&quot;

		<string>We laugh at the Indian philosopher, who to account for the support
of the earth, contrived the hypothesis of a huge elephant, and to support
the elephant, a huge tortoise.  If we will candidly confess the truth, we
know as little of the operation of the nerves, as he did of the manner in
which the earth is supported: and our hypothesis about animal spirits, or
about the tension and vibrations of the nerves, are as like to be true, as
his about the support of the earth.  His elephant was a hypothesis, and our
hypotheses are elephants.  Every theory in philosophy, which is built on
pure conjecture, is an elephant; and every theory that is supported partly
by fact, and partly by conjecture, is like Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s image, whose
feet were partly of iron, and partly of clay.

		<string>... we must be wary of granting too much power to natural selection
by viewing all basic capacities of our brain as direct adaptations.
I do not doubt that natural selection acted in building our oversized
brains -- and I am equally confident that our brains became large as
an adaptation for definite roles (probably a complex set of interacting
functions).  But these assumptions do not lead to the notion, often
uncritically embraced by strict Darwinians, that all major capacities
of the brain must arise as direct products of natural selection.

observations and inferences by the thousands.  The earth is billions of
years old and its living creatures are linked by ties of evolutionary
descent.  Scientists stand accused of promoting dogma by so stating, but
do we brand people illiberal when they proclaim that the earth is neither
flat nor at the center of the universe?  Science *has* taught us some
things with confidence!  Evolution on an ancient earth is as well
established as our planet&apos;s shape and position.  Our continuing struggle
to understand how evolution happens (the &quot;theory of evolution&quot;) does not
cast our documentation of its occurrence -- the &quot;fact of evolution&quot; --
into doubt.

mean?&quot;
	The director continued: &quot;When I was a little kid, I heard the story of
`Why the sea is salt&apos; many times, but I never thought it important until just
a moment ago.  It&apos;s something like this: Formerly the sea was fresh water and
salt was rare and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonderful
machine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller
thought himself the most fortunate man in the world, but soon all the villages
had salt to last them for centuries and still the machine kept on grinding
more salt.  The miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his
acres.  At last he determined that he would sink the machine in the sea and
be rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine
were sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that&apos;s
why the sea is salt.&quot;

		<string>A Hen Brooding Kittens
	A friend informs us that he saw at the Novato ranch, Marin county,
a few days since, a hen actually brooding and otherwise caring for three
kittens!  The gentleman upon whose premises this strange event is transpiring
says the hen adopted the kittens when they were but a few days old, and that
she has devoted them her undivided care for several weeks past.  The young
felines are now of respectable size, but they nevertheless follow the hen at
her cluckings, and are regularly brooded at night beneath her wings.

		<string>A Mexican newspaper reports that bored Royal Air Force pilots stationed
on the Falkland Islands have devised what they consider a marvelous new
game.  Noting that the local penguins are fascinated by airplanes, the
pilots search out a beach where the birds are gathered and fly slowly
along it at the water&apos;s edge.  Perhaps ten thousand penguins turn their
heads in unison watching the planes go by, and when the pilots turn
around and fly back, the birds turn their heads in the opposite
direction, like spectators at a slow-motion tennis match.  Then, the
paper reports &quot;The pilots fly out to sea and directly to the penguin
colony and overfly it.  Heads go up, up, up, and ten thousand penguins
fall over gently onto their backs.

		<string>A prominent broadcaster, on a big-game safari in Africa, was taken to a
watering hole where the life of the jungle could be observed. As he
looked down from his tree platform and described the scene into his
tape recorder, he saw two gnus grazing peacefully. So preoccupied were
they that they failed to observe the approach of a pride of lions led
by two magnificent specimens, obviously the leaders. The lions charged,
killed the gnus, and dragged them into the bushes where their feasting
could not be seen.  A little while later the two kings of the jungle
emerged and the radioman recorded on his tape: &quot;Well, that&apos;s the end of
the gnus and here, once again, are the head lions.&quot;

the man who said, &quot;No news is good news.&quot; In twenty-eight papers, only
the rarest kind of luck will turn up more than two or three articles of
any interest...  but even then the interest items are usually buried deep
around paragraph 16 on the jump (or &quot;Cont.  on ...&quot;) page...

The Post will have a story about Muskie making a speech in Iowa.  The
Star will say the same thing, and the Journal will say nothing at all.
But the Times might have enough room on the jump page to include a line
or so that says something like: &quot;When he finished his speech, Muskie
burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck.
They grappled briefly, but the struggle was kicked apart by an oriental
woman who seemed to be in control.&quot;

		<string>		Once Again From the Top

Correction notice in the Miami Herald: &quot;Last Sunday, The Herald erroneously
reported that original Dolphin Johnny Holmes had been an insurance salesman
in Raleigh, North Carolina, that he had won the New York lottery in 1982 and
lost the money in a land swindle, that he had been charged with vehicular
homicide, but acquitted because his mother said she drove the car, and that
he stated that the funniest thing he ever saw was Flipper spouting water on
George Wilson.  Each of these items was erroneous material published
inadvertently.  He was not an insurance salesman in Raleigh, did not win the
lottery, neither he nor his mother was charged or involved in any way with
vehicular homicide, and he made no comment about Flipper or George Wilson.
The Herald regrets the errors.&quot;

		<string>Climbing onto a bar stool, a piece of string asked for a beer.
	&quot;Wait a minute.  Aren&apos;t you a string?&quot;
	&quot;Well, yes, I am.&quot;
	&quot;Sorry.  We don&apos;t serve strings here.&quot;
	The determined string left the bar and stopped a passer-by.  &quot;Excuse,
me,&quot; it said, &quot;would you shred my ends and tie me up like a pretzel?&quot;  The
passer-by obliged, and the string re-entered the bar.  &quot;May I have a beer,
please?&quot; it asked the bartender.
	The barkeep set a beer in front of the string, then suddenly stopped.
&quot;Hey, aren&apos;t you the string I just threw out of here?&quot;

		<string>ELECTRIC JELL-O

2   boxes JELL-O brand gelatin	2 packages Knox brand unflavored gelatin
2   cups fruit (any variety)	2+ cups water
1/2 bottle Everclear brand grain alcohol

Mix JELL-O and Knox gelatin into 2 cups of boiling water.  Stir &apos;til
	fully dissolved.
Pour hot mixture into a flat pan.  (JELL-O molds won&apos;t work.)
Stir in grain alcohol instead of usual cold water.  Remove any congealing
	glops of slime. (Alcohol has an unusual effect on excess JELL-O.)
Pour in fruit to desired taste, and to absorb any excess alcohol.
Mix in some cold water to dilute the alcohol and make it easier to eat for
	the faint of heart.
Refrigerate overnight to allow mixture to fully harden. (About 8-12 hours.)
Cut into squares and enjoy!

WARNING:
	Keep ingredients away from open flame.  Not recommended for
	children under eight years of age.

		<string>Glogg (a traditional Scandinavian holiday drink):
	fifth of dry red wine
	fifth of Aquavit
	1 and 1/2 inch piece of cinnamon
	10 cardamom seeds
	1 cup raisins
	4 dried figs
	1 cup blanched or flaked almonds
	a few pieces of dried orange peel
	5 cloves
	1/2 lb. sugar cubes
	Heat up the wine and hard stuff (which may be substituted with wine
for the faint of heart) in a big pot after adding all the other stuff EXCEPT
the sugar cubes.  Just when it reaches boiling, put the sugar in a wire
strainer, moisten it in the hot brew, lift it out and ignite it with a match.
Dip the sugar several times in the liquid until it is all dissolved.  Serve
hot in cups with a few raisins and almonds in each cup.
	N.B. Aquavit may be hard to find and expensive to boot.  Use it only
if you really have a deep-seated desire to be fussy, or if you are of Swedish
extraction.

		<string>One dusty July afternoon, somewhere around the turn of the century, Patrick
Malone was in Mulcahey&apos;s Bar, bending an elbow with the other street car
conductors from the Brooklyn Traction Company.  While they were discussing the
merits of a local ring hero, the bar goes silent.  Malone turns around to see
his wife, with a face grim as death, stalking to the bar.
	Slapping a four-bit piece down on the bar, she draws herself up to her
full five feet five inches and says to Mulcahey, &quot;Give me what himself has
been havin&apos; all these years.&quot;
	Mulcahey looks at Malone, who shrugs, and then back at Margaret Mary
Malone.  He sets out a glass and pours her a triple shot of Rye.  The bar is
totally silent as they watch the woman pick up the glass and knock back the
drink.  She slams the glass down on the bar, gasps, shudders slightly, and
passes out; falling straight back, stiff as a board, saved from sudden contact
with the barroom floor by the ample belly of Seamus Fogerty.
	Sometime later, she comes to on the pool table, a jacket under her
head.  Her bloodshot eyes fell upon her husband, who says, &quot;And all these
years you&apos;ve been thinkin&apos; I&apos;ve been enjoying meself.&quot;

		<string>A [golf] ball hitting a tree shall be deemed not to have hit the tree.
Hitting a tree is simply bad luck and has no place in a scientific game.
The player should estimate the distance the ball would have traveled if it
had not hit the tree and play the ball from there, preferably atop a nice
firm tuft of grass.

		<string>A [golf] ball sliced or hooked into the rough shall be lifted and placed in
the fairway at a point equal to the distance it carried or rolled into the

penalized for the erratic behavior of the ball resulting from such
uncontrollable physical phenomena.

		<string>	A boy scout troop went on a hike.  Crossing over a stream, one of
the boys dropped his wallet into the water.  Suddenly a carp jumped, grabbed
the wallet and tossed it to another carp.  Then that carp passed it to
another carp, and all over the river carp appeared and tossed the wallet back

Warden.  After about a half mile the fella stopped and stooped over with
his hands on his thighs, whooping and heaving to catch his breath as the
Game Warden finally caught up to him.
	&quot;Let&apos;s see yer fishin&apos; license, boy,&quot; the Warden gasped.  The
man pulled out his wallet and gave the Game Warden a valid fishing
license.
	&quot;Well, son&quot;, snarled the Game Warden, &quot;You must be about as dumb

pheasant-raising, the apprehending of poachers, ways to control vermin,
and other chores and duties of the professional gamekeeper.

		<string>Brandy Davis, an outfielder and teammate of mine with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
is my choice for team captain.  Cincinnatti was beating us 3-1, and I led
off the bottom of the eighth with a walk.  The next hitter banged a hard
single to right field.  Feeling the wind at my back, I rounded second and
kept going, sliding safely into third base.
	With runners at first and third, and home-run hitter Ralph Kiner at
bat, our manager put in the fast Brandy Davis to run for the player at first.
Even with Kiner hitting and a change to win the game with a home run, Brandy
took off for second and made it.  Now we had runners at second and third.
	I&apos;m standing at third, knowing I&apos;m not going anywhere, and see Brandy
start to take a lead.  All of a sudden, here he comes.  He makes a great slide

		<string>	COONDOG MEMORY
	(heard in Rutledge, Missouri, about eighteen years ago)

Now, this dog is for sale, and she can not only follow a trail twice as
old as the average dog can, but she&apos;s got a pretty good memory to boot.
For instance, last week this old boy who lives down the road from me, and
is forever stinkmouthing my hounds, brought some city fellow around to
try out ol&apos; Sis here.  So I turned her out south of the house and she made
two or three big swings back and forth across the edge of the woods, set
back her head, bayed a couple of times, cut straight through the woods,
come to a little clearing, jumped about three foot straight up in the air,
run to the other side, and commenced to letting out a racket like she had
something treed.  We went over there with our flashlights and shone them
up in the tree but couldn&apos;t catch no shine offa coon&apos;s eyes, and my
neighbor sorta indicated that ol&apos; Sis might be a little crazy, `cause she
stood right to the tree and kept singing up into it.  So I pulled off my
coat and climbed up into the branches, and sure enough, there was a coon
skeleton wedged in between a couple of branches about twenty foot up.
Now as I was saying, she can follow a pretty old trail, but this fellow
was still calling her crazy or touched `cause she had hopped up in the
air while she was crossing the clearing, until I reminded him that the
Hawkins&apos; had a fence across there about five years back.  Now, this dog
is for sale.

	At his company&apos;s Fourth of July picnic, George brought his new pet
and announced that the animal could recite the entire Gettysburg Address.
No one believed him, and they proceeded to place bets against the dog.
George quieted the crowd and said, &quot;Now we&apos;ll begin!&quot;  Then he looked at
the dog.  The dog looked back.  No sound.  &quot;Come on, boy, do your stuff.&quot;

		<string>HARVARD:
Quarterback:
	Sophomore Dave Strewzinski... likes to pass.  And pass he does, with
a record 86 attempts (three completions) in 87 plays....  Though Strewzinksi
has so far failed to score any points for the Crimson, his jackrabbit speed
has made him the least sacked quarterback in the Ivy league.
Wide Receiver:
	The other directional signal in Harvard&apos;s offensive machine is senior
Phil Yip, who is very fast.  Yip is so fast that he has set a record for being
fast.  Expect to see Yip elude all pursuers and make it into the endzone five
or six times, his average for a game.  Yip, nicknamed &quot;fumblefingers&quot; and &quot;you
asshole&quot; by his teammates, hopes to carry the ball with him at least one of
those times.
YALE:
Defense:
	On the defensive side, Yale boasts the stingiest line in the Ivies.
Primarily responsible are seniors Izzy &quot;Shylock&quot; Bloomberg and Myron
Finklestein, the tightest ends in recent Eli history.  Also contributing to
the powerful defense is junior tackle Angus MacWhirter, a Scotsman who rounds
out the offensive ethnic joke.  Look for these three to shut down the opening

	(2) Never precede any maneuver by a comment more predictive
	   than &quot;Watch this!&quot;
	(3) The probability of a Frisbee hitting something is directly
	   proportional to the cost of hitting it.  For instance, a
	   Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman or
	   a little old lady rather than the beat up Chevy.
	(4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the
	   cute girl you&apos;ve been trying to impress is watching, the
	   Frisbee will invariably bounce out of your hand or hit you
	   in the head and knock you silly.

		<string>&quot;Oh, he [a big dog] hunts with papa,&quot; she said. &quot;He says Don Carlos [the
dog] is good for almost every kind of game.  He went duck hunting one time
and did real well at it.  Then Papa bought some ducks, not wild ducks but,
you know, farm ducks.  And it got Don Carlos all mixed up.  Since the
ducks were always around the yard with nobody shooting at them he knew he
wasn&apos;t supposed to kill them, but he had to do something.  So one morning
last spring, when the ground was still soft, he took all the ducks and
buried them.&quot;  &quot;What do you mean, buried them?&quot;  &quot;Oh, he didn&apos;t hurt them.
He dug little holes all over the yard and picked up the ducks in his mouth
and put them in the holes.  Then he covered them up with mud except for
their heads.  He did thirteen ducks that way and was digging a hole for
another one when Tony found him.  We talked about it for a long time.  Papa
said Don Carlos was afraid the ducks might run away, and since he didn&apos;t
know how to build a cage he put them in holes.  He&apos;s a smart dog.&quot;

		<string>Once there was this conductor see, who had a bass problem.  You see, during
a portion of Beethovan&apos;s Ninth Symphony in which there are no bass violin
parts, one of the bassists always passed a bottle of scotch around.  So,
to remind himself that the basses usually required an extra cue towards the
end of the symphony, the conductor would fasten a piece of string around the
page of the score before the bass cue.  As the basses grew more and more
inebriated, two of them fell asleep.  The conductor grew quite nervous (he
was very concerned about the pitch) because it was the bottom of the ninth;
the score was tied and the basses were loaded with two out.

in case of emergency.  As far as I can tell, our second basewoman is a pretty
good baseball player, better than I am, anyway, but there&apos;s no way to know
for sure because if the ball gets anywhere near her, a male comes barging
over from, say, right field, to deal with it.  She&apos;s been on the team for
three seasons now, but the males still don&apos;t trust her.  They know, deep in
their souls, that if she had to choose between catching a fly ball and saving
an infant&apos;s life, she probably would elect to save the infant&apos;s life, without
ever considering whether there were men on base.

when he made the comment that earns him a place in my Hall of Fame.  Second
baseman Steve Sax was having trouble making his throws.  Other players were
diving, screaming, signaling for a fair catch.  At the same time, Guerrero,
at third, was making a few plays that weren&apos;t exactly soothing to manager
Tom Lasorda&apos;s stomach.  Lasorda decided it was time for one of his famous
motivational meetings and zeroed in on Guerrero: &quot;How can you play third
base like that?  You&apos;ve gotta be thinking about something besides baseball.
What is it?&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m only thinking about two things,&quot; Guerrero said.  &quot;First, `I
hope they don&apos;t hit the ball to me.&apos;&quot;  The players snickered, and even
Lasorda had to fight off a laugh.  &quot;Second, `I hope they don&apos;t hit the ball

		<string>The Fastest Defeat In Chess

master.  
	In Paris during 1924 he was beaten after only four moves by a

chess enthusiasts may reconstruct this magnificent collapse in the comfort
of their own homes.
	Lazard was black and Gibaud white:
	1: P-Q4, Kt-KB3
	2: Kt-Q2, P-K4
	3: PxP, Kt-Kt5
	4: P-K6, Kt-K6
	White then resigns on realizing that a fifth move would involve
either a Q-KR5 check or the loss of his queen.

		<string>Love is like a friendship caught on fire.  In the beginning a flame, very

		<string>	&quot;No, I understand now,&quot; Auberon said, calm in the woods -- it was so

really.  Meet.  Love.  Part.  Life goes on.  There was never any reason to
expect her to stay always the same -- I mean `in love,&apos; you know.&quot;  There were

		<string>Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings

</string>
		<string>Speaking of love, one problem that recurs more and more frequently these
days, in books and plays and movies, is the inability of people to communicate
with the people they love; Husbands and wives who can&apos;t communicate, children
who can&apos;t communicate with their parents, and so on.  And the characters in
these books and plays and so on (and in real life, I might add) spend hours
bemoaning the fact that they can&apos;t communicate.  I feel that if a person can&apos;t
communicate, the very _____least he can do is to shut up!

		<string>	The birds are singing, the flowers are budding, and it is time
for Miss Manners to tell young lovers to stop necking in public.
	It&apos;s not that Miss Manners is immune to romance.  Miss Manners
has been known to squeeze a gentleman&apos;s arm while being helped over a
curb, and, in her wild youth, even to press a dainty slipper against a
foot or two under the dinner table.  Miss Manners also believes that the
sight of people strolling hand in hand or arm in arm or arm in hand
dresses up a city considerably more than the more familiar sight of
people shaking umbrellas at one another.  What Miss Manners objects to
is the kind of activity that frightens the horses on the street...

watching TV cartoon shows in the morning, and they&apos;ll show a commercial for
a children&apos;s compressed breakfast compound such as &quot;Froot Loops&quot; or &quot;Lucky
Charms&quot;, and they always show it sitting on a table next to some actual food
such as eggs, and the announcer always says: &quot;Part of this complete
breakfast&quot;.  Don&apos;t that really mean, &quot;Adjacent to this complete breakfast&quot;,
or &quot;On the same table as this complete breakfast&quot;?  And couldn&apos;t they make
essentially the same claim if, instead of Froot Loops, they put a can of
shaving cream there, or a dead bat?

		<string>For those of you who have been unfortunate enough to never have tasted the
&apos;Great Chieftain O&apos; the Pudden Race&apos; (i.e. haggis) here is an easy to follow
recipe which results in a dish remarkably similar to the above mentioned
protected species.
	Ingredients:
	  1 Sheep&apos;s Pluck (heart, lungs, liver) and bag
	  2 teacupsful toasted oatmeal
	  1 teaspoonful salt
	  8 oz. shredded suet
	  2 small onions
	1/2 teaspoonful black pepper
    
	Scrape and clean bag in cold, then warm, water.  Soak in salt water
overnight.  Wash pluck, then boil for 2 hours with windpipe draining over
the side of pot.  Retain 1 pint of stock.  Cut off windpipe, remove surplus
gristle, chop or mince heart and lungs, and grate best part of liver (about
half only).  Parboil and chop onions, mix all together with oatmeal, suet,
salt, pepper and stock to moisten.  Pack the mixture into bag, allowing for
swelling.  Boil for three hours, pricking regularly all over.  If bag not
available, steam in greased basin covered by greaseproof paper and cloth for
four to five hours.

3:  Carob is not an acceptable substitute for chocolate.  In fact, carob is not
    an acceptable substitute for anything, except, perhaps, brown shoe polish.
4:  There is no such thing as a &quot;fun salad.&quot;  So let&apos;s stop pretending and see
    salads for what they are:  God&apos;s punishment for being fat.
5:  Fruit salad without maraschino cherries and marshmallows is about as
    appealing as tepid beer.
6:  A world lacking gravy is a tragic place!
7:  You should immediately pass up any recipes entitled &quot;luscious and
    low-cal.&quot;  Also skip dishes featuring &quot;lively liver.&quot;  They aren&apos;t and
    it isn&apos;t.
8:  Wearing a blindfold often makes many diet foods more palatable.
9:  Fresh fruit is not dessert.  CAKE is dessert!
10: Okra tastes slightly worse than its name implies.
11: A plain baked potato isn&apos;t worth the effort involved in chewing and

		<string>How many hors d&apos;oeuvres you are allowed to take off a tray being carried by

	Two, but there are ways around it, depending on the style of the hors
d&apos;oeuvre.  If they&apos;re those little pastry things where you can&apos;t tell what&apos;s
inside, you take one, bite off about two-thirds of it, then say:  &quot;This is
cheese!  I hate cheese!&quot;  Then you put the rest of it back on the tray and
bite another one and go, &quot;Darn it!  Another cheese!&quot; and so on.

		<string>Lobster:
	Everyone loves these delectable crustaceans, but many cooks are
squeamish about placing them into boiling water alive, which is the only
proper method of preparing them.  Frankly, the easiest way to eliminate your
guilt is to establish theirs by putting them on trial before they&apos;re cooked.
The fact is, lobsters are among the most ferocious predators on the sea
floor, and you&apos;re helping reduce crime in the reefs.  Grasp the lobster
behind the head, look it right in its unmistakably guilty eyestalks and say,
&quot;Where were you on the night of the 21st?&quot;, then flourish a picture of a
scallop or a sole and shout, &quot;Perhaps this will refresh that crude neural
apparatus you call a memory!&quot;  The lobster will squirm noticeably.  It may
even take a swipe at you with one of its claws.  Incorrigible.  Pop it into
the pot.  Justice has been served, and shortly you and your friends will
be, too.

		<string>MOCK APPLE PIE (No Apples Needed)

  Pastry to two crust 9-inch pie	36 RITZ Crackers
2 cups water				 2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons cream of tartar		 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  Grated rind of one lemon		   Butter or margarine
  Cinnamon

Roll out bottom crust of pastry and fit into 9-inch pie plate.  Break
RITZ Crackers coarsely into pastry-lined plate.  Combine water, sugar
and cream of tartar in saucepan, boil gently for 15 minutes.  Add lemon
juice and rind.  Cool.  Pour this syrup over Crackers, dot generously
with butter or margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Cover with top
crust.  Trim and flute edges together.  Cut slits in top crust to let
steam escape.  Bake in a hot oven (425 F) 30 to 35 minutes, until crust
is crisp and golden.  Serve warm.  Cut into 6 to 8 slices.

eating coffee cake while listening to her exhortations, ask yourself
the following questions:

	(1) Do I dare trust a person who actually considers alfalfa sprouts a
	    food?
	(2) Was the author&apos;s sole motive in writing this book to get rich
	    exploiting the forlorn hopes of chubby people like me?
	(3) Would a longer life be worthwhile if it had to be lived as
	    prescribed ... without French-fried onion rings, pizza with
	    double cheese, or the occasional Mai-Tai?  (Remember, living
	    right doesn&apos;t really make you live longer, it just *seems* like
	    longer.)

		<string>RULES OF EATING -- THE BRONX DIETER&apos;S CREED
	(1)  Never eat on an empty stomach.
	(2)  Never leave the table hungry.
	(3)  When traveling, never leave a country hungry.
	(4)  Enjoy your food.
	(5)  Enjoy your companion&apos;s food.
	(6)  Really taste your food.  It may take several portions to
	     accomplish this, especially if subtly seasoned.
	(7)  Really feel your food.  Texture is important.  Compare,
	     for example, the texture of a turnip to that of a
	     brownie.  Which feels better against your cheeks?
	(8)  Never eat between snacks, unless it&apos;s a meal.
	(9)  Don&apos;t feel you must finish everything on your plate.  You
	     can always eat it later.
	(10) Avoid any wine with a childproof cap.
	(11) Avoid blue food.

the wineyness of a late sun, the intimate kiss of fertilizing rain, and the
bite of fire.  You must slice it thin, almost as thin as this page you hold

		<string>Without coffee he could not work, or at least he could not have worked in the
way he did.  In addition to paper and pens, he took with him everywhere as an
indispensable article of equipment the coffee machine, which was no less
important to him than his table or his white robe.

		<string>You can always tell the Christmas season is here when you start getting
incredibly dense, tinfoil-and-ribbon- wrapped lumps in the mail. Fruitcakes
make ideal gifts because the Postal Service has been unable to find a way to
damage them.  They last forever, largely because nobody ever eats them.  In
fact, many smart people save the fruitcakes they receive and send them back
to the original givers the next year; some fruitcakes have been passed back
and forth for hundreds of years.

The easiest way to make a fruitcake is to buy a darkish cake, then pound
some old, hard fruit into it with a mallet.  Be sure to wear safety glasses.

</string>
		<string>You must dine in our cafeteria.  You can eat dirt cheap there!!!!
</string>
		<string>You should tip the waiter $10, minus $2 if he tells you his name, another $2
if he claims it will be His Pleasure to serve you and another $2 for each
&quot;special&quot; he describes involving confusing terms such as &quot;shallots,&quot; and $4
if the menu contains the word &quot;fixin&apos;s.&quot; In many restaurants, this means the
waiter will actually owe you money. If you are traveling with a child aged
six months to three years, you should leave an additional amount equal to
twice the bill to compensate for the fact that they will have to take the
banquette out and burn it because the cracks are wedged solid with gobbets
made of partially chewed former restaurant rolls saturated with baby spit.

In New York, tip the taxicab driver $40 if he does not mention his hemorrhoids.

		<string>A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength.  It has been universally
established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon
or three normal sized billiard balls.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;A wizard cannot do everything; a fact most magicians are reticent to admit,
let alone discuss with prospective clients.  Still, the fact remains that 
there are certain objects, and people, that are, for one reason or another, 
completely immune to any direct magical spell.  It is for this group of
beings that the magician learns the subtleties of using indirect spells.
It also does no harm, in dealing with these matters, to carry a large club
near your person at all times.&quot;
		-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VIII
</string>
		<string>An ancient proverb summed it up: when a wizard is tired of looking for
broken glass in his dinner, it ran, he is tired of life.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>Chaos is King and Magic is loose in the world.
</string>
		<string>Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they become soggy and hard to
light.
</string>
		<string>Do not throw cigarette butts in the urinal, for they are subtle and
quick to anger.
</string>
		<string>&quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for you are crunchy and good
with ketchup.&quot;
</string>
		<string>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
		-- Aleister Crowley
</string>
		<string>Eight was also the Number of Bel-Shamharoth, which was why a sensible wizard
would never mention the number if he could avoid it.  Or you&apos;ll be eight
alive, apprentices were jocularly warned.  Bel-Shamharoth was especially
attracted to dabblers in magic who, by being as it were beachcombers on the
shores of the unnatural, were already half-enmeshed in his nets.
Rincewind&apos;s room number in his hall of residence had been 7a.  He hadn&apos;t
been surprised.

		<string>&quot;How do you know she is a unicorn?&quot; Molly demanded.  &quot;And why were you afraid
to let her touch you?  I saw you.  You were afraid of her.&quot;
	&quot;I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,&quot; the cat
replied without rancor.  &quot;I would not waste time in foolishness if I were 
you.  As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be
deceived by appearances.  Unlike human beings, who enjoy them.  As for your
second question --&quot;  Here he faltered, and suddenly became very interested
in washing; nor would he speak until he had licked himself fluffy and then
licked himself smooth again.  Even then he would not look at Molly, but 
examined his claws.
	&quot;If she had touched me,&quot; he said very softly, &quot;I would have been
hers and not my own, not ever again.&quot;
		-- Peter S. Beagle, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;
</string>
		<string>It is a well known fact that warriors and wizards do not get along, because
one side considers the other side to be a collection of bloodthirsty idiots
who can&apos;t walk and think at the same time, while the other side is naturally
suspicious of a body of men who mumble a lot and wear long dresses.  Oh, say
the wizards, if we&apos;re going to be like that, then, what about all those
studded collars and oiled muscles down at the Young Men&apos;s Pagan Association?
To which the heroes reply, that&apos;s a pretty good allegation from a bunch of
wimpsoes who won&apos;t go near a woman on account, can you believe it, of their
mystical power being sort of drained out.  Right, say the wizards, that just
about does it, you and your leather posing pouches.  Oh yeah, say the the
heroes, why don&apos;t you ...

		<string>It is well known that *things* from undesirable universes are always seeking

		<string>	It seems there&apos;s this magician working one of the luxury cruise ships
for a few years.  He doesn&apos;t have to change his routines much as the audiences
change over fairly often, and he&apos;s got a good life.   The only problem is the
ship&apos;s parrot, who perches in the hall and watches him night after night, year
after year.  Finally, the parrot figures out how almost every trick works and
starts giving it away for the audience.  For example, when the magician makes
a bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squawks &quot;Behind his back!  Behind
his back!&quot;  Well, the magician is really annoyed at this, but there&apos;s not much
he can do about it as the parrot is a ship&apos;s mascot and very popular with the
passengers.
	One night, the ship strikes some floating debris, and sinks without
a trace.  Almost everyone aboard was lost, except for the magician and the
parrot.  For three days and nights they just drift, with the magician clinging
to one end of a piece of driftwood and the parrot perched on the other end.
As the sun rises on the morning of the fourth day, the parrot walks over to
the magician&apos;s end of the log.  With obvious disgust in his voice, he snaps
&quot;OK, you win, I give up.  Where did you hide the ship?&quot;
</string>
		<string>Knowledge is power -- knowledge shared is power lost.
		-- Aleister Crowley
</string>
		<string>Magic is always the best solution -- especially reliable magic.
</string>
		<string>No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife in the shoulder blades will seriously
cramp his style.
</string>
		<string>Rincewind had generally been considered by his tutors to be a natural wizard
in the same way that fish are natural mountaineers.  He probably would have
been thrown out of Unseen University anyway--he couldn&apos;t remember spells and
smoking made him feel ill.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>Somewhere, just out of sight, the unicorns are gathering.
</string>
		<string>The default Magic Word, &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, actually is a corruption of the
Hebrew phrase &quot;ha-Bracha dab&apos;ra&quot; which means &quot;pronounce the blessing&quot;.
</string>
		<string>&quot;The first rule of magic is simple.  Don&apos;t waste your time waving your
hands and hoping when a rock or a club will do.&quot;
		-- McCloctnik the Lucid
</string>
		<string>	The seven eyes of Ningauble the Wizard floated back to his hood as he
reported to Fafhrd: &quot;I have seen much, yet cannot explain all.  The Gray
Mouser is exactly twenty-five feet below the deepest cellar in the palace
of Gilpkerio Kistomerces.  Even though twenty-four parts in twenty-five of
him are dead, he is alive.
	&quot;Now about Lankhmar.  She&apos;s been invaded, her walls breached
everywhere and desperate fighting is going on in the streets, by a fierce
host which out-numbers Lankhamar&apos;s inhabitants by fifty to one -- and
equipped with all modern weapons.  Yet you can save the city.&quot;
	&quot;How?&quot; demanded Fafhrd.
	Ningauble shrugged.  &quot;You&apos;re a hero.  You should know.&quot;
		-- Fritz Leiber, &quot;The Swords of Lankhmar&quot;
</string>
		<string>	&quot;Then what is magic for?&quot; Prince Lir demanded wildly.  &quot;What use is
wizardry if it cannot save a unicorn?&quot;  He gripped the magician&apos;s shoulder
hard, to keep from falling.
	Schmendrick did not turn his head.  With a touch of sad mockery in
his voice, he said, &quot;That&apos;s what heroes are for.&quot;
...
	&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; he [Prince Lir] said.  &quot;That is exactly what heroes
are for.  Wizards make no difference, so they say that nothing does, but
heroes are meant to die for unicorns.&quot;
		-- Peter Beagle, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;
</string>
		<string>There are those who claim that magic is like the tide; that it swells and
fades over the surface of the earth, collecting in concentrated pools here
and there, almost disappearing from other spots, leaving them parched for
wonder.  There are also those who believe that if you stick your fingers up
your nose and blow, it will increase your intelligence.
		-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VII
</string>
		<string>Unseen University had never admitted women, muttering something about
problems with the plumbing, but the real reason was an unspoken dread that
if women were allowed to mess around with magic they would probably be
embarrassingly good at it ...

</string>
		<string>Using words to describe magic is like using a screwdriver to cut roast beef.
		-- Tom Robbins
</string>
		<string>	&quot;Verily and forsooth,&quot; replied Goodgulf darkly.  &quot;In the past year
strange and fearful wonders I have seen.  Fields sown with barley reap
crabgrass and fungus, and even small gardens reject their artichoke hearts.
There has been a hot day in December and a blue moon.  Calendars are made with
a month of Sundays and a blue-ribbon Holstein bore alive two insurance
salesmen.  The earth splits and the entrails of a goat were found tied in
square knots.  The face of the sun blackens and the skies have rained down
soggy potato chips.&quot;
	&quot;But what do all these things mean?&quot; gasped Frito.
	&quot;Beats me,&quot; said Goodgulf with a shrug, &quot;but I thought it made good
copy.&quot;
		-- Harvard Lampoon, &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;
</string>
		<string>Watch Rincewind.

Look at him.  Scrawny, like most wizards, and clad in a dark red robe on
which a few mystic sigils were embroidered in tarnished sequins. Some might
have taken him for a mere apprentice enchanter who had run away from his
master out of defiance, boredom, fear and a lingering taste for
heterosexuality.  Yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon
that marked him as an alumnus of Unseen University, the high school of magic
whose time-and-space transcendent campus is never precisely Here or There.
Graduates were usually destined for mageship at least, but Rincewind--after
an unfortunate event--had left knowing only one spell and made a living of
sorts around the town by capitalizing on an innate gift for languages.  He
avoided work as a rule, but had a quickness of wit that put his
acquaintances in mind of a bright rodent.

I will then say the magic words to you, and you, too, will vanish -- never
to be seen again.

		<string>A cow is a completely automated milk-manufacturing machine. It is encased
in untanned leather and mounted on four vertical, movable supports, one at
each corner.  The front end of the machine, or input, contains the cutting
and grinding mechanism, utilizing a unique feedback device.  Here also are
the headlights, air inlet and exhaust, a bumper and a foghorn.
	At the rear, the machine carries the milk-dispensing equipment as
well as a built-in flyswatter and insect repeller.  The central portion
houses a hydro- chemical-conversion unit.  Briefly, this consists of four
fermentation and storage tanks connected in series by an intricate network
of flexible plumbing.  This assembly also contains the central heating plant
complete with automatic temperature controls, pumping station and main
ventilating system.  The waste disposal apparatus is located to the rear of
this central section.
	Cows are available fully-assembled in an assortment of sizes and
colors.  Production output ranges from 2 to 20 tons of milk per year.  In
brief, the main external visible features of the cow are:  two lookers, two
hookers, four stander-uppers, four hanger-downers, and a swishy-wishy.

takes off and disappears into the distance.

That pig run up and wiggled underneath that tree and lifted it off of me.
Saved my life.&quot;
	&quot;Fantastic!  the salesman said.  But tell me, how come the pig has
three wooden legs?&quot;
	The farmer stared at the newcomer in amazement.  &quot;Mister, when you 
got an amazin&apos; pig like that, you don&apos;t eat him all at once.&quot;

everyone should do at least 6 times a day.  In an effort to increase the
national average  (the US ranks third among the world&apos;s superpowers in
smiling), Xerox has instructed all personnel to be happy, effervescent, and
most importantly, to smile.  Xerox employees agree, and even feel strongly
that they can not only meet but surpass the national average...  except for
Tubby Ackerman.  But because Tubby does such a fine job of racing around
parking lots with a large butterfly net retrieving floating IC chips, Xerox
decided to give him a break.  If you see Tubby in a parking lot he may have
a sheepish grin.  This is where the expression, &quot;Service with a slightly
sheepish grin&quot; comes from.

		<string>All this big deal about white collar crime -- what&apos;s WRONG with white collar
crime?  Who enjoys his job today?  You?  Me?  Anybody?  The only satisfying
part of any job is coffee break, lunch hour and quitting time.  Years ago
there was at least the hope of improvement -- eventual promotion -- more
important jobs to come.  Once you can be sold the myth that you may make
president of the company you&apos;ll hardly ever steal stamps.  But nobody 
believes he&apos;s going to be president anymore.  The more people change jobs
the more they realize that there is a direct connection between working for
a living and total stupefying boredom.  So why NOT take revenge?  You&apos;re not
going to find ME knocking a guy because he pads an expense account and his

It can be seen from 10,000 feet, silhouetted against the snow.
Government officials exchanged memos full of circumlocutions (no Latin

		<string>But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who was a
brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and
lived in New Jersey.  Edison&apos;s first major invention in 1877, was the
phonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of American homes, where
it basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented.  But Edison&apos;s
greatest achievement came in 1879, when he invented the electric company.
Edison&apos;s design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple electrical circuit:
the electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, then
immediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this is
the brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of
electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few
customers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact the
last year any new electricity was generated in the United States was 1937;
the electric companies have been merely re-selling it ever since, which is
why they have so much free time to apply for rate increases.

		<string>	By the middle 1880&apos;s, practically all the roads except those in
the South, were of the present standard gauge.  The southern roads were
still five feet between rails.
	It was decided to change the gauge of all southern roads to standard,
in one day.  This remarkable piece of work was carried out on a Sunday in May
of 1886.  For weeks beforehand, shops had been busy pressing wheels in on the
axles to the new and narrower gauge, to have a supply of rolling stock which
could run on the new track as soon as it was ready.  Finally, on the day set,
great numbers of gangs of track layers went to work at dawn.  Everywhere one
rail was loosened, moved in three and one-half inches, and spiked down in its
new position.  By dark, trains from anywhere in the United States could operate
over the tracks in the South, and a free interchange of freight cars everywhere
was possible.

		<string>Dear Mister Language Person: What is the purpose of the apostrophe?

Answer: The apostrophe is used mainly in hand-lettered small business signs
to alert the reader than an &quot;S&quot; is coming up at the end of a word, as in:
WE DO NOT EXCEPT PERSONAL CHECK&apos;S, or: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ITEM&apos;S.
Another important grammar concept to bear in mind when creating hand- lettered
small-business signs is that you should put quotation marks around random
words for decoration, as in &quot;TRY&quot; OUR HOT DOG&apos;S, or even TRY &quot;OUR&quot; HOT DOG&apos;S.

		<string>	Home centers are designed for the do-it-yourselfer who&apos;s willing to

		<string>	If you&apos;re like most homeowners, you&apos;re afraid that many repairs
around your home are too difficult to tackle.  So, when your furnace
explodes, you call in a so-called professional to fix it.  The
&quot;professional&quot; arrives in a truck with lettering on the sides and deposits a
large quantity of tools and two assistants who spend the better part of the
week in your basement whacking objects at random with heavy wrenches, after
which the &quot;professional&quot; returns and gives you a bill for slightly more
money than it would cost you to run a successful campaign for the U.S.
Senate.
	And that&apos;s why you&apos;ve decided to start doing things yourself. You
figure, &quot;If those guys can fix my furnace, then so can I.  How difficult can
it be?&quot;
	Very difficult.  In fact, most home projects are impossible, which
is why you should do them yourself.  There is no point in paying other
people to screw things up when you can easily screw them up yourself for far
less money.  This article can help you.

M:	Confusing -- is that a total of 9 appendages?
R:	Mice have four leg-foot assemblies and one tail assembly per body.
M:	Does not fully discuss the issue!
R:	Each mouse comes equipped with four legs and a tail.  Each leg
	is equipped with a foot at the end opposite the body; the tail
	is not equipped with a foot.
M:	Descriptive?  Yes.  Forceful NO!
R:	Allotment of appendages for mice will be:  Four foot-leg assemblies,
	one tail.  Deviation from this policy is not permitted as it would

		<string>	NEW YORK-- Kraft Foods, Inc. announced today that its board of
directors unanimously rejected the $11 billion takeover bid by Philip
Morris and Co. A Kraft spokesman stated in a press conference that the
offer was rejected because the $90-per-share bid did not reflect the
true value of the company.
	Wall Street insiders, however, tell quite a different story.
Apparently, the Kraft board of directors had all but signed the takeover
agreement when they learned of Philip Morris&apos; marketing plans for one of
their major Middle East subsidiaries.  To a person, the board voted to
reject the bid when they discovered that the tobacco giant intended to
reorganize Israeli Cheddar, Ltd., and name the new company Cheeses of Nazareth.

forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a

	Go to one of those really cheap discount stores where they sell
plastic furniture in colors visible from the planet Neptune and where they
have a food section specializing in cardboard cartons full of Raisinets and
malted milk balls manufactured during the Nixon administration.  In either
the hardware or housewares department, you&apos;ll find an item imported from an
obscure Oriental country and described as &quot;Nine Tools in One&quot;, consisting of
a little handle with interchangeable ends representing inscrutable Oriental
notions of tools that Americans might use around the home.  Buy it.
	This is the kind of tool set professionals use.  Not only is it
inexpensive, but it also has a great safety feature not found in the

and drove off along the route.  No problems for the first few stops -- a few
people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.  At the next
stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on.  Six feet eight, built like a
wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground.  He glared at the driver and said,
&quot;Big John doesn&apos;t pay!&quot; and sat down at the back.
	Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically
meek?  Well, he was.  Naturally, he didn&apos;t argue with Big John, but he wasn&apos;t
happy about it.  Well, the next day the same thing happened -- Big John got on
again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down.  And the next day, and the
one after that, and so forth.  This grated on the bus driver, who started
losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.  Finally he
could stand it no longer. He signed up for bodybuilding courses, karate, judo,
and all that good stuff.  By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong;
what&apos;s more, he felt really good about himself.
	So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus
and said &quot;Big John doesn&apos;t pay!,&quot; the driver stood up, glared back at the
passenger, and screamed, &quot;And why not?&quot;
	With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, &quot;Big John has a
bus pass.&quot;

laughed.  &quot;You will not succeed,&quot; they told him.  &quot;No one can.&quot;

happen in that time.  The king might die.  The horse might die.  I might die.

		<string>One possible reason that things aren&apos;t going according to plan
is that there never was a plan in the first place.
</string>
		<string>One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could
manufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they be
installed on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let&apos;s say your
congressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on how
the French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when he
got to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, would
inflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through the
plane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman
proposed a law.  (&quot;Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October be
designated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.&quot;)
This would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public
would violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.  The problem
is that your potential market is very small: there are only around 500

		<string>	Plumbing is one of the easier of do-it-yourself activities,
requiring only a few simple tools and a willingness to stick your arm into a
clogged toilet.  In fact, you can solve many home plumbing problems, such as
annoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the radio.  But before we get
into specific techniques, let&apos;s look at how plumbing works.
	A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system, except
that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires, it has
pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets and toilets.
So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at all like your
electrical system, which is good, because electricity can kill you.

session.  Our Achievement Awards this year are in the fields of publishing,

publishing our award goes to editor, R.L.K., [...] for his unrivalled alle-
giance without variation to the statement: &quot;Personally I&apos;d love to do it,
we&apos;d ALL love to do it.  But we&apos;re not going to do it.  It&apos;s not the kind of
book our house knows how to handle.&quot;  Our superior performance award in the
field of advertising goes to media executive, E.L.M., [...] for the continu-
ally creative use of the old favorite: &quot;I think what you&apos;ve got here could be
very exciting.  Why not give it one more try based on the approach I&apos;ve out-
lined and see if you can come up with something fresh.&quot;  Our final award for
courageous holding action in the field of industry goes to supervisor, R.S.,
[...] for her unyielding grip on &quot;I don&apos;t care if they fire me, I&apos;ve been
arguing for a new approach for YEARS but are we SURE that this is the right
time--&quot;  I would like to conclude this meeting with a verse written specially
for our prospectus by our founding president fifty years ago -- and now, as

		<string>The departing division general manager met a last time with his young

and I&apos;ll pass the tradition along to you,&quot; he said.  &quot;At the first sign
of trouble, open the first envelope.  Any further difficulties, open the
second envelope.  Then, if problems continue, open the third envelope.
Good luck.&quot;  The new manager returned to his office and tossed the envelopes
into a drawer.
	Six months later, costs soared and earnings plummeted. Shaken, the
young man opened the first envelope, which said, &quot;Blame it all on me.&quot;
	The next day, he held a press conference and did just that.  The
crisis passed.
	Six months later, sales dropped precipitously.  The beleagured
manager opened the second envelope.  It said, &quot;Reorganize.&quot;
	He held another press conference, announcing that the division
would be restructured.  The crisis passed.
	A year later, everything went wrong at once and the manager was
blamed for all of it.  The harried executive closed his office door, sank
into his chair, and opened the third envelope.
	&quot;Prepare three envelopes...&quot; it said.

		<string>The Worst Car Hire Service
	When David Schwartz left university in 1972, he set up Rent-a-wreck
as a joke.  Being a natural prankster, he acquired a fleet of beat-up
shabby, wreckages waiting for the scrap heap in California.
	He put on a cap and looked forward to watching people&apos;s faces as he
conducted them round the choice of bumperless, dented junkmobiles.
	To his lasting surprise there was an insatiable demand for them and
he now has 26 thriving branches all over America.  &quot;People like driving
round in the worst cars available,&quot; he said.  Of course they do.
	&quot;If a driver damages the side of a car and is honest enough to
admit it, I tell him, `Forget it&apos;.  If they bring a car back late we
overlook it.  If they&apos;ve had a crash and it doesn&apos;t involve another vehicle
we might overlook that too.&quot;
	&quot;Where&apos;s the ashtray?&quot; asked on Los Angeles wife, as she settled
into the ripped interior.  &quot;Honey,&quot; said her husband, &quot;the whole car&apos;s the
ash tray.&quot;

	If a man would not labour in the salt and rock quarries then he
should not accept of the Earth that which he refuses to give of
himself.

	Such a man would expect a pear of a peach tree.

		<string>	They are fools that think that wealth or women or strong drink or even
drugs can buy the most in effort out of the soul of a man.  These things offer
pale pleasures compared to that which is greatest of them all, that task which
demands from him more than his utmost strength, that absorbs him, bone and
sinew and brain and hope and fear and dreams -- and still calls for more.
	They are fools that think otherwise.  No great effort was ever bought.
No painting, no music, no poem, no cathedral in stone, no church, no state was
ever raised into being for payment of any kind.  No parthenon, no Thermopylae
was ever built or fought for pay or glory; no Bukhara sacked, or China ground
beneath Mongol heel, for loot or power alone.  The payment for doing these
things was itself the doing of them.
	To wield onself -- to use oneself as a tool in one&apos;s own hand -- and
so to make or break that which no one else can build or ruin -- THAT is the
greatest pleasure known to man!  To one who has felt the chisel in his hand
and set free the angel prisoned in the marble block, or to one who has felt
sword in hand and set homeless the soul that a moment before lived in the body
of his mortal enemy -- to those both come alike the taste of that rare food
spread only for demons or for gods.&quot;

		<string>This is an especially good time for you vacationers who plan to fly, because
the Reagan administration, as part of the same policy under which it
recently sold Yellowstone National Park to Wayne Newton, has &quot;deregulated&quot;
the airline industry.  What this means for you, the consumer, is that the
airlines are no longer required to follow any rules whatsoever.  They can
show snuff movies.  They can charge for oxygen.  They can hire pilots right
out of Vending Machine Refill Person School.  They can conserve fuel by
ejecting husky passengers over water.  They can ram competing planes in
mid-air.  These innovations have resulted in tremendous cost savings which
have been passed along to you, the consumer, in the form of flights with
amazingly low fares, such as $29.  Of course, certain restrictions do apply,
the main one being that all these flights take you to Newark, and you must
pay thousands of dollars if you want to fly back out.

company works.  Your telephone is connected to a local computer, which is in
turn connected to a regional computer, which is in turn connected to a
loudspeaker the size of a garbage truck on the lawn of Edna A. Bargewater of
Lawrence, Kan.

Whenever you talk on the phone, your local computer listens in.  If it
suspects you&apos;re going to discuss an intimate topic, it notifies the computer
above it, which listens in and decides whether to alert the one above it,
until finally, if you really humiliate yourself, maybe break down in tears
and tell your closest friend about a sordid incident from your past
involving a seedy motel, a neighbor&apos;s spouse, an entire religious order, a
garden hose and six quarts of tapioca pudding, the top computer feeds your
conversation into Edna&apos;s loudspeaker, and she and her friends come out on
the porch to listen and drink gin and laugh themselves silly.

		<string>Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an
infinitely large Universe, such as the one in which we live, most things one
could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow
somewhere.  A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew
ratchet screwdrivers as fruit.  The life cycle of the ratchet screwdriver is
quite interesting.  Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can
lie undisturbed for years.  Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its
outer skin that crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable
little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a hole
for a screw.  This, when found, will get thrown away.  No one knows what the
screwdriver is supposed to gain from this.  Nature, in her infinite wisdom,
is presumably working on it.

	There are not as many people actually working as you may have thought.
	The population of this country is 200 million.  84 million are over
60 years of age, which leaves 116 million to do the work.  People under 20
years of age total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.
	There are 22 million who are employed by the government, which leaves
19 million to do the work.  Four million are in the Armed Services, which
leaves 15 million to do the work.  Deduct 14,800,000, the number in the state
and city offices, leaving 200,000 to do the work.  There are 188,000 in
hospitals, insane asylums, etc., so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.
	Now it may interest you to know that there are 11,998 people in jail,
so that leaves just 2 people to carry the load. That is you and me, and
brother, I&apos;m getting tired of doing everything myself!

&quot;I simply can&apos;t say enough good things about him.&quot;
	(What a screw-up.)
&quot;I am pleased to say that this candidate is a former colleague of mine.&quot;
	(I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am that she left our firm.)
&quot;When this person left our employ, we were quite hopeful he would go
a long way with his skills.&quot;

&quot;You won&apos;t find many people like her.&quot;

	What they meant:

&quot;If you knew this person as well as I know him, you would think as much

	(Or as little, to phrase it slightly more accurately.)
&quot;Her input was always critical.&quot;
	(She never had a good word to say.)
&quot;I have no doubt about his capability to do good work.&quot;
	(And it&apos;s nonexistent.)
&quot;This candidate would lend balance to a department like yours, which
already has so many outstanding members.&quot;
	(Unless you already have a moron.)
&quot;His presentation to my seminar last semester was truly remarkable:
one unbelievable result after another.&quot;

&quot;You will be fortunate if you can get him to work for you.&quot;
	(We certainly never succeeded.)
There is no other employee with whom I can adequately compare him.
	(Well, our rats aren&apos;t really employees...)
&quot;Success will never spoil him.&quot;
	(Well, at least not MUCH more.)
&quot;One usually comes away from him with a good feeling.&quot;
	(And such a sigh of relief.)
&quot;His dissertation is the sort of work you don&apos;t expect to see these days;
in it he has definitely demonstrated his complete capabilities.&quot;
	(And his IQ, as well.)
&quot;He should go far.&quot;
	(The farther the better.)
&quot;He will take full advantage of his staff.&quot;
	(He even has one of them mowing his lawn after work.)

	In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one
	aircraft.  This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and
	Navy 3-1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be
	made available to the Marines for the extra day.
XVII:
	Software is like entropy.  It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing,
	and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics, i.e., it always increases.
XVIII:
	It is very expensive to achieve high unreliability.  It is not uncommon
	to increase the cost of an item by a factor of ten for each factor of
	ten degradation accomplished.
XIX:
	Although most products will soon be too costly to purchase, there will
	be a thriving market in the sale of books on how to fix them.
XX:
	In any given year, Congress will appropriate the amount of funding
	approved the prior year plus three-fourths of whatever change the
	administration requests -- minus 4-percent tax.
		-- Norman Augustine
</string>
		<string>XXI:
	It&apos;s easy to get a loan unless you need it.
XXII:
	If stock market experts were so expert, they would be buying stock,
	not selling advice.
XXIII:
	Any task can be completed in only one-third more time than is
	currently estimated.
XXIV:
	The only thing more costly than stretching the schedule of an
	established project is accelerating it, which is itself the most
	costly action known to man.
XXV:
	A revised schedule is to business what a new season is to an athlete
	or a new canvas to an artist.
		-- Norman Augustine
</string>
		<string>XXVI:
	If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on each
	other, it can be assured that disaster is not left to chance.
XXVII:
	Rank does not intimidate hardware.  Neither does the lack of rank.
XXVIII:
	It is better to be the reorganizer than the reorganizee.
XXIX:
	Executives who do not produce successful results hold on to their
	jobs only about five years.  Those who produce effective results
	hang on about half a decade.
XXX:
	By the time the people asking the questions are ready for the answers,
	the people doing the work have lost track of the questions.
		-- Norman Augustine
</string>
		<string>XXXI:
	The optimum committee has no members.
XXXII:
	Hiring consultants to conduct studies can be an excellent means of
	turning problems into gold -- your problems into their gold.
XXXIII:
	Fools rush in where incumbents fear to tread.
XXXIV:
	The process of competitively selecting contractors to perform work
	is based on a system of rewards and penalties, all distributed
	randomly.
XXXV:
	The weaker the data available upon which to base one&apos;s conclusion,
	the greater the precision which should be quoted in order to give
	the data authenticity.
		-- Norman Augustine
</string>
		<string>XXXVI:
	The thickness of the proposal required to win a multimillion dollar
	contract is about one millimeter per million dollars.  If all the
	proposals conforming to this standard were piled on top of each other
	at the bottom of the Grand Canyon it would probably be a good idea.
XXXVII:
	Ninety percent of the time things will turn out worse than you expect.
	The other 10 percent of the time you had no right to expect so much.
XXXVIII:
	The early bird gets the worm.
	The early worm ... gets eaten.
XXXIX:
	Never promise to complete any project within six months of the end of
	the year -- in either direction.
XL:
	Most projects start out slowly -- and then sort of taper off.
		-- Norman Augustine

Mr. Smith of Muddle, Mass. says:  &quot;Before I took this course I used to be
a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech I feel really
important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best.&quot;

Mr. Watkins had this to say:  &quot;Ten short days ago all I could look forward
to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising future and
make really big Zorkmids.&quot;

MIT Tech can&apos;t promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

	&quot;You must mean two-by-four&apos;s&quot; replies the clerk.
	The man scratches his head.  &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;ll go
check.&quot; 
	Back, after an animated conversation with the other occupants of the
truck, he reassures the clerk, that, yes, in fact, two-by-fours would be
acceptable.
	&quot;OK,&quot; says the clerk, writing it down, &quot;how long you want &apos;em?&quot;
	The guy gets the blank look again.  &quot;Uh... I guess I better go
check,&quot; he says.
	He goes back out to the truck, and there&apos;s another animated
conversation.  The guy comes back into the office.  &quot;A long time,&quot; he says,

		-- Royal Floyd Mengot (Klaus)
</string>
		<string>	[I plan] to see, hear, touch, and destroy everything in my path,
including beets, rutabagas, and most random vegetables, but excluding yams,
as I am absolutely terrified of yams...
	Actually, I think my fear of yams began in my early youth, when many
of my young comrades pelted me with same for singing songs of far-off lands
and deep blue seas in a language closely resembling that of the common sow.
My psychosis was further impressed into my soul as I reached adolescence,
when, while skipping through a field of yams, light-heartedly tossing flowers
into the stratosphere, a great yam-picking machine tore through the fields,
pursuing me to the edge of the great plantation, where I escaped by diving
into a great ditch filled with a mixture of water and pig manure, which may
explain my tendency to scream, &quot;Here come the Martians!  Hide the eggs!&quot; every
time I have pork.  But I digress.  The fact remains that I cannot rationally
deal with yams, and pigs are terrible conversationalists.

laid to rest after a eulogy by Jackie Collins, fellow member of SAFE [Society

This is easy.  You never have to figure out what to get for children,
because they will tell you exactly what they want.  They spend months and
months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday- morning
cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children exactly what
they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices.  If your child thinks
he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You Can Rip Right Off, you&apos;d
better get it.  You may be worried that it might help to encourage your
child&apos;s antisocial tendencies, but believe me, you have not seen antisocial
tendencies until you&apos;ve seen a child who is convinced that he or she did not
get the right gift.

to greet me with 60 or 70 thousand playful nips, any one of which -- bear
in mind that I am naked and, without my contact lenses, essentially blind
-- could result in the kind of injury where you have to learn a whole new
part if you want to sing the &quot;Messiah,&quot; if you get my drift.  Then I hop

have -- you cannot teach it; they either have it or they don&apos;t -- has chosen
exactly that moment to flush one of the toilets.  Perhaps several of them.

		<string>	On this morning in August when I was 13, my mother sent us out pick
tomatoes.  Back in April I&apos;d have killed for a fresh tomato, but in August
they are no more rare or wonderful than rocks.  So I picked up one and threw
it at a crab apple tree, where it made a good *splat*, and then threw a tomato
at my brother.  He whipped one back at me.  We ducked down by the vines,
heaving tomatoes at each other.  My sister, who was a good person, said,
&quot;You&apos;re going to get it.&quot;  She bent over and kept on picking.
	What a target!  She was 17, a girl with big hips, and bending over,
she looked like the side of a barn.
	I picked up a tomato so big it sat on the ground.  It looked like it
had sat there a week.  The underside was brown, small white worms lived in it,
and it was very juicy.  I stood up and took aim, and went into the windup,
when my mother at the kitchen window called my name in a sharp voice.  I had
to decide quickly.  I decided.
	A rotten Big Boy hitting the target is a memorable sound, like a fat
man doing a belly-flop.  With a whoop and a yell the tomatoee came after
faster than I knew she could run, and grabbed my shirt and was about to brain
me when Mother called her name in a sharp voice.  And my sister, who was a
good person, obeyed and let go -- and burst into tears.  I guess she knew that
the pleasure of obedience is pretty thin compared with the pleasure of hearing
a rotten tomato hit someone in the rear end.

     Do not put statements in the negative form.
     And don&apos;t start sentences with a conjunction.
     If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great
     deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.
     Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.
     Unqualified superlatives are the worst of all.
     If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.
     Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.
     Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
     Also, avoid awkward or affected alliteration.
     Last, but not least, avoid cliche&apos;s like the plague.

		<string>Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the
approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty&apos;s Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted
for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence.
	Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains
unaccounted for in one infantry battalion&apos;s petty cash and there has been
a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to
one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain.  This
reprehensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance,
since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitehall.
	This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government so that I
may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains.
I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
given below.  I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but
I cannot do both:
	1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the
benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance:
	2. To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain.

		<string>	Graduating seniors, parents and friends...
	Let me begin by reassuring you that my remarks today will stand up
to the most stringent requirements of the new appropriateness.
	The intra-college sensitivity advisory committee has vetted the
text of even trace amounts of subconscious racism, sexism and classism.
	Moreover, a faculty panel of deconstructionists have reconfigured
the rhetorical components within a post-structuralist framework, so as to
expunge any offensive elements of western rationalism and linear logic.
	Finally, all references flowing from a white, male, eurocentric
perspective have been eliminated, as have any other ruminations deemed
denigrating to the political consensus of the moment.

	Thank you and good luck.

		<string>Great Moments in History: #3

August 27, 1949:
	A Hall of Fame opened to honor outstanding members of the
	Women&apos;s Air Corp.  It was a WAC&apos;s Museum.
</string>
		<string>	Grover Cleveland, though constantly at loggerheads with the
Senate, got on better with the House of Representatives.  A popular
story circulating during his presidency concerned the night he was
roused by his wife crying, &quot;Wake up!  I think there are burglars in the
house.&quot;
	&quot;No, no, my dear,&quot; said the president sleepily, &quot;in the Senate maybe,
but not in the House.&quot;
</string>
		<string>Grub first, then ethics.
		-- Bertolt Brecht
</string>
		<string>Hark ye, Clinker, you are a most notorious offender.  You stand convicted of
sickness, hunger, wretchedness, and want.
		-- Tobias Smollet
</string>
		<string>Has the great art and mystery of politics no apparent utility? Does it
appear to be unqualifiedly ratty, raffish, sordid, obscene and low down,
and its salient virtuosi a gang of umitigated scoundrels?  Then let us
not forget its high capacity to soothe and tickel the midriff, its
incomparable services as a maker of entertainment.
		-- H.L. Mencken, &quot;A Carnival of Buncombe&quot;
</string>
		<string>Have you noticed the way people&apos;s intelligence capabilities decline
sharply the minute they start waving guns around?
		-- Dr. Who
</string>
		<string>He didn&apos;t run for reelection.  &quot;Politics brings you into contact with all
the people you&apos;d give anything to avoid,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m staying home.&quot;

		<string>Hear me, my chiefs, I am tired; my heart is sick and sad.  From where the
sun now stands I Will Fight No More Forever.
		-- Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce
</string>
		<string>Here comes the orator, with his flood of words and his drop of reason.
</string>
		<string>History has much to say on following the proper procedures.  From a history
of the Mexican revolution:
	&quot;Hidalgo was later defeated at Guadalajara.  The rebel army was
captured on its way through the mountains.  All were courtmartialed and
shot, except Hidalgo, because he was a priest.  He was handed over to
the bishop of Durango who excommunicated him and returned him to the
army where he was then executed.&quot;
</string>
		<string>History is on our side (as long as we can control the historians).
</string>
		<string>History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree on.
		-- Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;Maxims&quot;
</string>
		<string>History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,
periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts them
asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing grub, at
intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...  Truly the imago
state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult is a step gained.
		-- Charles Darwin, from &quot;Origin of the Species&quot;
</string>
		<string>History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have

		<string>I don&apos;t care how poor and inefficient a little country is; they like to

</string>
		<string>I might have gone to West Point, but I was too proud to speak to a congressman.

		<string>I owe the government $3400 in taxes.  So I sent them two hammers and a
toilet seat.
		-- Michael McShane
</string>
		<string>I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as
the greatest of dangers to be feared.  To preserve our independence, we must
not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.  If we run into such debts, we
must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our necessities and in our comforts,
in our labor and in our amusements.  If we can prevent the government from
wasting the labor of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they
will be happy.
		-- Thomas Jefferson
</string>
		<string>I pledge allegiance to the flag

and to the republic for which it stands,
one nation,
indivisible,
with liberty

</string>
		<string>I prefer the most unjust peace to the most righteous war.
		-- Cicero

Even peace may be purchased at too high a price.
		-- Poor Richard
</string>
		<string>I realize that the MX missile is none of our concern.  I realize that the
whole point of living in a democracy is that we pay professional
congresspersons to concern themselves with things like the MX missile so we
can be free to concern ourselves with getting hold of the plumber.

But from time to time, I feel I must address major public issues such as
this, because in a free and open society, where the very future of the world
hinges on decisions made by our elected leaders, you never win large cash
journalism awards if you stick to the topics I usually write about, such as
nose-picking.
		-- Dave Barry, &quot;At Last, the Ultimate Deterrent Against

</string>
		<string>I see a good deal of talk from Washington about lowering taxes.  I hope
they do get &apos;em lowered down enough so people can afford to pay &apos;em.

</string>
		<string>I use not only all the brains I have, but all those I can borrow as well.
		-- Woodrow Wilson
</string>
		<string>I used to be a rebel in my youth.

This cause... that cause... (chuckle) I backed &apos;em ALL!  But I learned.
Rebellion is simply a device used by the immature to hide from his own
problems.  So I lost interest in politics.  Now when I feel aroused by
a civil rights case or a passport hearing... I realize it&apos;s just a device.
I go to my analyst and we work it out.  You have no idea how much better
I feel these days.
		-- J. Feiffer
</string>
		<string>I want to be the white man&apos;s brother, not his brother-in-law.
		-- Martin Luther King, Jr.
</string>
		<string>I was appalled by this story of the destruction of a member of a valued
endangered species.  It&apos;s all very well to celebrate the practicality of
pigs by ennobling the porcine sibling who constructed his home out of
bricks and mortar.  But to wantonly destroy a wolf, even one with an
excessive taste for porkers, is unconscionable in these ecologically
critical times when both man and his domestic beasts continue to maraud
the earth.
		Sylvia Kamerman, &quot;Book Reviewing&quot;
</string>
		<string>I was offered a job as a hoodlum and I turned it down cold.  A thief is
anybody who gets out and works for his living, like robbing a bank or
breaking into a place and stealing stuff, or kidnapping somebody.  He really
gives some effort to it.  A hoodlum is a pretty lousy sort of scum.  He
works for gangsters and bumps guys off when they have been put on the spot.
Why, after I&apos;d made my rep, some of the Chicago Syndicate wanted me to work
for them as a hood -- you know, handling a machine gun.  They offered me
two hundred and fifty dollars a week and all the protection I needed.  I
was on the lam at the time and not able to work at my regular line.  But
I wouldn&apos;t consider it.  &quot;I&apos;m a thief,&quot; I said.  &quot;I&apos;m no lousy hoodlum.&quot;
		-- Alvin Karpis, &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;
</string>
		<string>I went to my mother and told her I intended to commence a different life.  I
asked for and obtained her blessing and at once commenced the career of a
robber.

</string>
		<string>I wish a robot would get elected president.  That way, when he came to town,
we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.

</string>
		<string>I would like the government to do all it can to mitigate, then, in

		<string>I&apos;d like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the
whole field to private industry.

		<string>	Once there was a marine biologist who loved dolphins. He spent his
time trying to feed and protect his beloved creatures of the sea.  One day,
in a fit of inventive genius, he came up with a serum that would make
dolphins live forever!
	Of course he was ecstatic. But he soon realized that in order to mass
produce this serum he would need large amounts of a certain compound that was
only found in nature in the metabolism of a rare South American bird.  Carried
away by his love for dolphins, he resolved that he would go to the zoo and
steal one of these birds.
	Unbeknownst to him, as he was arriving at the zoo an elderly lion was
escaping from its cage.  The zookeepers were alarmed and immediately began
combing the zoo for the escaped animal, unaware that it had simply lain down
on the sidewalk and had gone to sleep.
	Meanwhile, the marine biologist arrived at the zoo and procured his
bird.  He was so excited by the prospect of helping his dolphins that he
stepped absentmindedly stepped over the sleeping lion on his way back to his
car.  Immediately, 1500 policemen converged on him and arrested him for
transporting a myna across a staid lion for immortal porpoises.

		<string>Once upon a time there was a kingdom ruled by a great bear.  The peasants
were not very rich, and one of the few ways to become at all wealthy was
to become a Royal Knight.  This required an interview with the bear.  If
the bear liked you, you were knighted on the spot.  If not, the bear would
just as likely remove your head with one swat of a paw.  However, the family
of these unfortunate would-be knights was compensated with a beautiful
sheepdog from the royal kennels, which was itself a fairly valuable
possession.  And the moral of the story is:
 
The mourning after a terrible knight, nothing beats the dog of the bear that

		<string>	Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas.  Five years later?
Six?  It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era -- the kind of peak that
never comes again.  San Fransisco in the middle sixties was a very special time
and place to be a part of.  Maybe it meant something.  Maybe not, in the long
run...  There was madness in any direction, at any hour.  If not across the
Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda...  You could
strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we
were doing was right, that we were winning...
	And that, I think, was the handle -- that sense of inevitable victory
over the forces of Old and Evil.  Not in any mean or military sense; we didn&apos;t
need that. Our energy would simply prevail.  There was no point in fighting
-- on our side or theirs.  We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.  So now, less than five years later, you can go
up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes
you can almost ___see the high-water mark -- that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back.

		<string>The Least Successful Executions
	History has furnished us with two executioners worthy of attention.
The first performed in Sydney in Australia.  In 1803 three attempts were
made to hang a Mr. Joseph Samuels.  On the first two of these the rope
snapped, while on the third Mr. Samuels just hung there peacefully until he
and everyone else got bored.  Since he had proved unsusceptible to capital
punishment, he was reprieved.
	The most important British executioner was Mr. James Berry who
tried three times in 1885 to hang Mr. John Lee at Exeter Jail, but on each
occasion failed to get the trap door open.
	In recognition of this achievement, the Home Secretary commuted
Lee&apos;s sentence to &quot;life&quot; imprisonment.  He was released in 1917, emigrated
to America and lived until 1933.

schnauzer hound, who was retired from the Orlando police force in Florida
in 1978.  He consistently refused to do anything which might ruffle or
offend the criminal classes.
	His handling officer, Rick Grim, had to admit: &quot;He just won&apos;t go up
and bite them.  I got sick and tired of doing that dog&apos;s work for him.&quot;
	The British contenders in this category, however, took things a
stage further.  &quot;Laddie&quot; and &quot;Boy&quot; were trained as detector dogs for drug
raids.  Their employment was terminated following a raid in the Midlands in
1967.
	While the investigating officer questioned two suspects, they
patted and stroked the dogs who eventually fell asleep in front of the
fire.  When the officer moved to arrest the suspects, one dog growled at
him while the other leapt up and bit his thigh.

		<string>The Worst Bank Robbery
	In August 1975 three men were on their way in to rob the Royal Bank of
Scotland at Rothesay, when they got stuck in the revolving doors.  They
had to be helped free by the staff and, after thanking everyone,
sheepishly left the building.
	A few minutes later they returned and announced their intention of
robbing the bank, but none of the staff believed them.  When they demanded
5,000 pounds in cash, the head cashier laughed at them, convinced that it
was a practical joke.
	Then one of the men jumped over the counter, but fell to the floor
clutching his ankle.  The other two tried to make their getaway, but got
trapped in the revolving doors again.

		<string>The Worst Prison Guards
	The largest number of convicts ever to escape simultaneously from a
maximum security prison is 124.  This record is held by Alcoente Prison,
near Lisbon in Portugal.
	During the weeks leading up to the escape in July 1978 the prison
warders had noticed that attendances had fallen at film shows which
included &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, and also that 220 knives and a huge quantity
of electric cable had disappeared.  A guard explained, &quot;Yes, we were
planning to look for them, but never got around to it.&quot;  The warders had
not, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were
&quot;covered with posters&quot;.  Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,
water hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.
The night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36
prisoners in his block only 13 were present.  He said this was &quot;normal&quot;
because inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back
the next morning.
	&quot;We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when
one of the prisoners told us,&quot; a warder said later.  [...]  When they
eventually checked, the prison guards found that exactly half of the gaol&apos;s
population was missing.  By way of explanation the Justice Minister, Dr.
Santos Pais, claimed that the escape was &quot;normal&quot; and part of the
&quot;legitimate desire of the prisoner to regain his liberty.&quot;

		<string>Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers
in heavy weather for several days.  I was serving on the lead battleship and
was on watch on the bridge as night fell.  The visibility was poor with patchy
fog, so the Captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities.
	Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported,
&quot;Light, bearing on the starboard bow.&quot;
	&quot;Is it steady or moving astern?&quot; the Captain called out.
	Lookout replied, &quot;Steady, Captain,&quot; which meant we were on a dangerous
collision course with that ship.
	The Captain then called to the signalman, &quot;Signal that ship: We are on
a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	Back came a signal &quot;Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	In reply, the Captain said, &quot;Send: I&apos;m a Captain, change course 20
degrees!&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m a seaman second class,&quot; came the reply, &quot;You had better change
course 20 degrees.&quot;
	By that time, the Captain was furious. He spit out, &quot;Send: I&apos;m a
battleship, change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	Back came the flashing light: &quot;I&apos;m a lighthouse!&quot;
	We changed course.

		<string>What does it take for Americans to do great things; to go to the moon, to
win wars, to dig canals linking oceans, to build railroads across a continent?
In independent thought about this question, Neil Armstrong and I concluded
that it takes a coincidence of four conditions, or in Neil&apos;s view, the
simultaneous peaking of four of the many cycles of American life.  First, a
base of technology must exist from which to do the thing to be done.  Second,
a period of national uneasiness about America&apos;s place in the scheme of human
activities must exist.  Third, some catalytic event must occur that focuses
the national attention upon the direction to proceed.  Finally, an articulate
and wise leader must sense these first three conditions and put forth with
words and action the great thing to be accomplished.  The motivation of young
Americans to do what needs to be done flows from such a coincidence of
conditions. ...  The Thomas Jeffersons, The Teddy Roosevelts, The John
Kennedys appear.  We must begin to create the tools of leadership which they,
and their young frontiersmen, will require to lead us onward and upward.

&quot;(1) How much did you make?  (AMOUNT)
(2) How much did we here at the government take out?  (AMOUNT)
(3) Hey!  Sounds like we took too much!  So we&apos;re going to
     send an official government check for (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF

     you please! Which just goes to show you, (YOUR FIRST
