		<string>Gay shlafen:  Yiddish for &quot;go to sleep&quot;.

Now doesn&apos;t &quot;gay shlafen&quot; have a softer, more soothing sound than the
harsh, staccato &quot;go to sleep&quot;?  Listen to the difference:
	&quot;Go to sleep, you little wretch!&quot; ... &quot;Gay shlafen, darling.&quot;
Obvious, isn&apos;t it?
	Clearly the best thing you can do for you children is to start
speaking Yiddish right now and never speak another word of English as
long as you live.  This will, of course, entail teaching Yiddish to all
your friends, business associates, the people at the supermarket, and
so on, but that&apos;s just the point.  It has to start with committed
individuals and then grow....
	Some minor adjustments will have to be made, of course: those
signs written in what look like Yiddish letters won&apos;t be funny when
everything is written in Yiddish.  And we&apos;ll have to start driving on
the left side of the road so we won&apos;t be reading the street signs
backwards.  But is that too high a price to pay for world peace?
I think not, my friend, I think not.

According to probably reliable sources, the Coca-Cola people are experiencing

	Bite the wax tadpole.
	There is a sort of rough justice, is there not?
	The trouble with this fact, as lovely as it is, is that it&apos;s hard

So frightened did he become that his stomach turned over and he threw up all

woke the bruiser, and Moishe, his heart in his mouth, rose to the occasion.

		<string>	Some 1500 miles west of the Big Apple we find the Minneapple, a
haven of tranquility in troubled times.  It&apos;s a good town, a civilized town.
A town where they still know how to get your shirts back by Thursday.  Let
the Big Apple have the feats of &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; Namath.  We have known the
stolid but steady Killebrew.  Listening to Cole Porter over a dry martini
may well suit those unlucky enough never to have heard the Whoopee John Polka
Band and never to have shared a pitcher of 3.2 Grain Belt Beer.  The loss is
theirs.  And the Big Apple has yet to bake the bagel that can match peanut
butter on lefse.  Here is a town where the major urban problem is dutch elm
disease and the number one crime is overtime parking.  We boast more theater
per capita than the Big Apple.  We go to see, not to be seen.  We go even
when we must shovel ten inches of snow from the driveway to get there.  Indeed
the winters are fierce.  But then comes the marvel of the Minneapple summer.
People flock to the city&apos;s lakes to frolic and rejoice at the sight of so
much happy humanity free from the bonds of the traditional down-filled parka.
Here&apos;s to the Minneapple.  And to its people.  Our flair for style is balanced
by a healthy respect for wind chill factors.
	And we always, always eat our vegetables.

		<string>	The world&apos;s most avid baseball fan (an Aggie) had arrived at the
stadium for the first game of the World Series only to realize he had left
his ticket at home.  Not wanting to miss any of the first inning, he went
to the ticket booth and got in a long line for another seat.  After an hour&apos;s
wait he was just a few feet from the booth when a voice called out, &quot;Hey,
Dave!&quot;  The Aggie looked up, stepped out of line and tried to find the owner
of the voice -- with no success.   Then he realized he had lost his place in
line and had to wait all over again.  When the fan finally bought his ticket,
he was thirsty, so he went to buy a drink.  The line at the concession stand
was long, too, but since the game hadn&apos;t started he decided to wait.  Just as
he got to the window, a voice called out, &quot;Hey, Dave!&quot;  Again the Aggie tried
to find the voice -- but no luck.  He was very upset as he got back in line
for his drink.  Finally the fan went to his seat, eager for the game to begin.
As he waited for the pitch, he heard the voice calling, &quot;Hey Dave!&quot; once more.
Furious, he stood up and yelled at the top of his lungs,  &quot;My name isn&apos;t Dave!&quot;

day he decided to stop in downstairs for some fresh liver.  Well, the owner

whispered, &quot;Weigh down upon the swami&apos;s liver!&quot;

		<string>There was this New Yorker that had a lifelong ambition to be an Texan.
Fortunately, he had an Texan friend and went to him for advice.  &quot;Mike,

should I do?&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; answered Mike, &quot;The first thing you&apos;ve got to do is look
like a Texan.  That means you have to dress right.  The second thing
you&apos;ve got to do is speak in a southern drawl.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks, Mike, I&apos;ll give it a try,&quot; replied the New Yorker.
	A few weeks passed and the New Yorker saunters into a store dressed
in a ten-gallon hat, cowboy boots, Levi jeans and a bandanna.  &quot;Hey, there,
pardner, I&apos;d like some beef, not too rare, and some of them fresh biscuits,&quot;
he tells the counterman.
	The guy behind the counter takes a long look at him and then says,
&quot;You must be from New York.&quot;

It is my contention that, if this definition be accepted, there is no country
in the world wherein a man constituted as I am -- a man of my peculiar
weaknesses, vanities, appetites, and aversions -- can be so happy as he can

		<string>THIS IS PLEDGE WEEK FOR THE FORTUNE PROGRAM

If you like the fortune program, why not support it now with your
contribution of a pithy fortunes, clean or obscene?  We cannot continue
without your support.  Less than 14% of all fortune users are contributors.
That means that 86% of you are getting a free ride.  We can&apos;t go on like
this much longer.  Federal cutbacks mean less money for fortunes, and unless
user contributions increase to make up the difference, the fortune program
will have to shut down between midnight and 8 a.m.  Don&apos;t let this happen.
Mail your fortunes right now to &quot;fortune&quot;.  Just type in your favorite pithy
saying.  Do it now before you forget.  Our target is 300 new fortunes by the
end of the week. Don&apos;t miss out.  All fortunes will be acknowledged.  If you
contribute 30 fortunes or more, you will receive a free subscription to &quot;The
Fortune Hunter&quot;, our monthly program guide.  If you contribute 50 or more,
you will receive a free &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot; coffee mug ....

his arms furiously.  Amazingly, rather than plummeting to his death the little

   some simple lieder and work your way up to a symphony.&quot;
Q: &quot;But Herr Mozart, you were writing symphonies when you were 8 years old.&quot;

		<string>Around the turn of this century, a composer named Camille Saint-Saens wrote
a satirical zoological-fantasy called &quot;Le Carnaval des Animaux.&quot;  Aside from
one movement of this piece, &quot;The Swan&quot;, Saint-Saens didn&apos;t allow this work
to be published or even performed until a year had elapsed after his death.
(He died in 1921.)
	Most of us know the &quot;Swan&quot; movement rather well, with its smooth,
flowing cello melody against a calm background; but I&apos;ve been having this
fantasy...
	What if he had written this piece with lyrics, as a song to be sung?
And, further, what if he had accompanied this song with a musical saw?  (This
instrument really does exist, often played by percussionists!)  Then the
piece would be better known as:

		<string>Hoaars-Faisse Gallery presents:
An exhibit of works by the artist known only as Pretzel.

The exhibit includes several large conceptual works using non-traditional
media and found objects including old sofa-beds, used mace canisters,
discarded sanitary napkins and parts of freeways.  The artist explores
our dehumanization due to high technology and unresponsive governmental
structures in a post-industrial world.  She/he (the artist prefers to
remain without gender) strives to create dialogue between viewer and
creator, to aid us in our quest to experience contemporary life with its
inner-city tensions, homelessness, global warming and gender and
class-based stress.  The works are arranged to lead us to the essence of
the argument: that the alienation of the person/machine boundary has
sapped the strength of our voices and must be destroyed for society to
exist in a more fundamental sense.

     its situation.
	Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.  He
	loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to
	look down.  At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per
	second per second takes over.
 II. Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter
     intervenes suddenly.
	Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon
	characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a telephone
	pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward motion absolutely.
	Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the
	stooge&apos;s surcease.
III. Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation
     conforming to its perimeter.
	Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
	speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless
	cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through
	the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole.  The
	threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.

		<string>IV. The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or
    equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to
    spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.
	Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture it
	inevitably unsuccessful.
 V. All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
	Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel
	them directly away from the earth&apos;s surface.  A spooky noise or an
	adversary&apos;s signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to
	the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.
	The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding
	auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.
VI. As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once.
	This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a
	character&apos;s head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of
	altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common
	as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled.  A &quot;wacky&quot;
	character has the option of self-replication only at manic high
	speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.

sleeves, and they&apos;d always waste precious minutes saying things: &quot;Do
you think something&apos;s wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow her?

		<string>My band career ended late in my senior year when John Cooper and I threw my
amplifier out the dormitory window.  We did not act in haste. First we
checked to make sure the amplifier would fit through the frame, using the
belt from my bathrobe to measure, then we picked up the amplifier and backed
up to my bedroom door.  Then we rushed forward, shouting &quot;The WHO!  The
WHO!&quot; and we launched my amplifier perfectly, as though we had been doing it
all our lives, clean through the window and down onto the sidewalk, where a
small but appreciative crowd had gathered.  I would like to be able to say
that this was a symbolic act, an effort on my part to break cleanly away
from one state in my life and move on to another, but the truth is, Cooper
and I really just wanted to find out what it would sound like.  It sounded

left in a rarely used chow hall for over two centuries and wakes up in a world
populated by soybean created imitations under the evil Dick Tater.  Thanks to
him, the soy-potatoes learn that being a &apos;tater is where it&apos;s at.  Memorable

unsuspecting, would-be teen camp cooks.  Scenes include a girl being stuffed

with beets and dressing.  Definitely not for the squeamish, or those on
diets that are driving them crazy.

	A FISTFUL OF FRIES: Western in which our hero, The Spud with No Name,

		<string>So do the noble fall.  For they are ever caught in a trap of their own making.
A trap -- walled by duty, and locked by reality.  Against the greater force
they must fall -- for, against that force they fight because of duty, because
of obligations.  And when the noble fall, the base remain.  The base -- whose
only purpose is the corruption of what the noble did protect.  Whose only
purpose is to destroy.  The noble: who, even when fallen, retain a vestige of
strength.  For theirs is a strength born of things other than mere force.
Theirs is a strength supreme... theirs is the strength -- to restore.

		<string>	So Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark].
With a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to
maneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of
corner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to
flop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward
it, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and --
I can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in
the armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.
	Many people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and
I were not &quot;many people.&quot;  We were experienced waders, and we kept our
heads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you&apos;re
unarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water
up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the
opposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of
our feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all
the way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers
cartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen
these two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked
into trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.

		<string>	The big problem with pornography is defining it.  You can&apos;t just
say it&apos;s pictures of people naked.  For example, you have these
primitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,
and they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal
saying goes: &quot;N&apos;wam k&apos;honi soit qui mali,&quot; which means, &quot;If you think
you can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same
time, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of
Northern Mali that you may be interested in.&quot;
	So it&apos;s not considered pornographic when National Geographic
publishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest
naked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason
naked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an
article entitled &quot;The Girls of the California Junior College System
Hunt the Wildebeest Naked,&quot; some people would call it pornography.  But
others would not.  And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.
Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.

		<string>The Worst Musical Trio
	There are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at
a famous concert hall while still learning the rudiments of their
instrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian
gentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated
violinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite
unhampered by great musical talent.
	Three years later the boy&apos;s father insisted that he give a public
concert.  &quot;His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.
A cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.&quot;  Although
Enesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau
in Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.
	&quot;Then you must accompany him on the piano,&quot; said the boy&apos;s father,
&quot;and it will be a sell out.&quot;
	Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited
audience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and
asked for someone to turn his pages.
	In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who
volunteered and made his way to the stage.
	The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the
music critic of Le Figaro wrote: &quot;There was a strange concert at the Salle
Gaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played
the piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.
But the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.&quot;

		<string>There&apos;s a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to
recognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over -- and to let
go.  It means leaving what&apos;s over without denying its validity or its
past importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief
that every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.
The trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It&apos;s hard to
recognize that life isn&apos;t a holding action, but a process.  It&apos;s hard to
learn that we don&apos;t leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the
dugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences
and the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take
ourselves along -- quite gracefully.

		<string> VII. Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel
      entrances; others cannot.
	This trompe l&apos;oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least
	it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall&apos;s surface to
	trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical
	space.  The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to
	follow into the painting.  This is ultimately a problem of art, not
	of science.
VIII. Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent.
	Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives
	might comfortably afford.  They can be decimated, spliced, splayed,
	accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, but they cannot be
	destroyed.  After a few moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate,
	elongate, snap back, or solidify.
  IX. For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance.
	This is the one law of animated cartoon motion that also applies to
	the physical world at large.  For that reason, we need the relief of
	watching it happen to a duck instead.
   X. Everything falls faster than an anvil.
	Examples too numerous to mention from the Roadrunner cartoons.

	from the natives, who, are friendly, but seem to be hiding something.
	Kirk, Spock, Bones, Yeoman Rand and two red shirt security officers
	beam down to the planet, where the two security officers are promply
	killed by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured.
	As something begins to develop between the Captain and Yeoman Rand,
	Scotty, back in orbit, is attacked by a Klingon destroyer and must
	warp out of orbit.  Although badly outgunned, he cripples the Klingon
	and races back to the planet in order to rescue Kirk et. al. who have
	just saved the natives&apos; from an awful fate and, as a reward, been
	given all light bulbs they can carry.  The new bulb is then inserted
	and the Enterprise continues on its five year mission.

		<string>A book is the work of a mind, doing its work in the way that a mind deems
best.  That&apos;s dangerous.  Is the work of some mere individual mind likely to
serve the aims of collectively accepted compromises, which are known in the

work all alone is surely a bad example for the students, and probably, if
not downright antisocial, at least a little off-center, self-indulgent,
elitist.  ... It&apos;s just good pedagogy, therefore, to stay away from such
stuff, and use instead, if film-strips and rap-sessions must be

		<string>	 A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling
			  by Mark Twain

	For example, in Year 1 that useless letter &quot;c&quot; would be dropped
to be replased either by &quot;k&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, and likewise &quot;x&quot; would no longer
be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which &quot;c&quot; would be retained
would be the &quot;ch&quot; formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2
might reform &quot;w&quot; spelling, so that &quot;which&quot; and &quot;one&quot; would take the
same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish &quot;y&quot; replasing it with
&quot;i&quot; and Iear 4 might fiks the &quot;g/j&quot; anomali wonse and for all.
	Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear

		<string>Abstract:
	This study examined the incidence of neckwear tightness among a group
of 94 white-collar working men and the effect of a tight business-shirt collar
and tie on the visual performance of 22 male subjects.  Of the white-collar
men measured, 67% were found to be wearing neckwear that was tighter than
their neck circumference.  The visual discrimination of the 22 subjects was
evaluated using a critical flicker frequency (CFF) test.  Results of the CFF
test indicated that tight neckwear significantly decreased the visual
performance of the subjects and that visual performance did not improve
immediately when tight neckwear was removed.

		<string>Briefly stated, the findings are that when presented with an array of
data or a sequence of events in which they are instructed to discover
an underlying order, subjects show strong tendencies to perceive order
and causality in random arrays, to perceive a pattern or correlation
which seems a priori intuitively correct even when the actual correlation
in the data is counterintuitive, to jump to conclusions about the correct
hypothesis, to seek and to use only positive or confirmatory evidence, to
construe evidence liberally as confirmatory, to fail to generate or to
assess alternative hypotheses, and having thus managed to expose themselves
only to confirmatory instances, to be fallaciously confident of the validity
of their judgments (Jahoda, 1969; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1978).  In the
analyzing of past events, these tendencies are exacerbated by failure to
appreciate the pitfalls of post hoc analyses.

</string>
		<string>If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get
the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.  See in
college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural
method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall
learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should
be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the
young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.
I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not
by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise
instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the
attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools,
not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to
put on a professor.

		<string>	In a forest a fox bumps into a little rabbit, and says, &quot;Hi,
Junior, what are you up to?&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m writing a dissertation on how rabbits eat foxes,&quot; said the
rabbit.
	&quot;Come now, friend rabbit, you know that&apos;s impossible!  No one
will publish such rubbish!&quot;
	&quot;Well, follow me and I&apos;ll show you.&quot;
	They both go into the rabbit&apos;s dwelling and after a while the
rabbit emerges with a satisfied expression on his face.  Comes along a
wolf.  &quot;Hello, little buddy, what are we doing these days?&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m writing the 2&apos;nd chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits devour
wolves.&quot;
	&quot;Are you crazy?  Where&apos;s your academic honesty?&quot;
	&quot;Come with me and I&apos;ll show you.&quot;
	As before, the rabbit comes out with a satisfied look on his face
and a diploma in his paw.  Finally, the camera pans into the rabbit&apos;s cave
and, as everybody should have guessed by now, we see a mean-looking, huge
lion, sitting, picking his teeth and belching, next to some furry, bloody
remnants of the wolf and the fox.

	The moral: It&apos;s not the contents of your thesis that are
important -- it&apos;s your PhD advisor that really counts.

		<string>It has long been an article of our folklore that too much knowledge or skill,
or especially consummate expertise, is a bad thing.  It dehumanizes those who
achieve it, and makes difficult their commerce with just plain folks, in whom
good old common sense has not been obliterated by mere book learning or fancy
notions.  This popular delusion flourishes now more than ever, for we are all
infected with it in the schools, where educationists have elevated it from
folklore to Article of Belief.  It enhances their self-esteem and lightens
their labors by providing theoretical justification for deciding that
appreciation, or even simple awareness, is more to be prized than knowledge,
and relating (to self and others), more than skill, in which minimum
competence will be quite enough.

</string>
		<string>	It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and
by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate
the habit of thinking about what we are doing.  The precise opposite is the
case.  Civilization advances by extending the numbers of important operations
which we can perform without thinking about them.  Operations of thought are
like cavalry charges in battle -- they are strictly limited in number, they
require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.

proof that abstract thought has occurred; abstract thought is a mark of

		<string>cerebral atrophy, n:
	The phenomena which occurs as brain cells become weak and sick, and
impair the brain&apos;s performance.  An abundance of these &quot;bad&quot; cells can cause
symptoms related to senility, apathy, depression, and overall poor academic
performance.  A certain small number of brain cells will deteriorate due to
everday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental effort
and the assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students become
victims of this dread disorder due to poor habits such as overstudying.

cerebral darwinism, n:
	The theory that the effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversed
through the purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts of
alcohol cause many brain cells to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through
the process of natural selection, the weak and sick brain cells will die
first, leaving only the healthy cells.  This wonderful process leaves the
imbiber with a healthier, more vibrant brain, and increases mental capacity.
Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academic
performance actually increases beyond previous levels.

order &quot;The Best of Wagner&quot;, &quot;The Best of Schubert&quot;, or &quot;The Best of the Turds&quot;.

		<string>Engram, n.:
	1. The physical manifestation of human memory -- &quot;the engram.&quot;
2. A particular memory in physical form.  [Usage note:  this term is no longer
in common use.  Prior to Wilson and Magruder&apos;s historic discovery, the nature
of the engram was a topic of intense speculation among neuroscientists,
psychologists, and even computer scientists.  In 1994 Professors M. R. Wilson
and W. V. Magruder, both of Mount St. Coax University in Palo Alto, proved
conclusively that the mammalian brain is hardwired to interpret a set of
thirty seven genetically transmitted cooperating TECO macros.  Human memory
was shown to reside in 1 million Q-registers as Huffman coded uppercase-only
ASCII strings.  Interest in the engram has declined substantially since that
time.]

	Some early etymological scholars came up with derivations that

	(&quot;study of&quot;).  It meant &quot;the study of things that are hard to swallow.&quot;

		<string>Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):

Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs.  Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a horse
of another color, and by the lemma [&quot;All horses are the same color&quot;],
that does not exist.

		<string>Fortune&apos;s Rules for Memo Wars: #2

Given the incredible advances in sociocybernetics and telepsychology over
the last few years, we are now able to completely understand everything that
the author of an memo is trying to say.  Thanks to modern developments
in electrocommunications like notes, vnews, and electricity, we have an
incredible level of interunderstanding the likes of which civilization has
never known.  Thus, the possibility of your misinterpreting someone else&apos;s
memo is practically nil.  Knowing this, anyone who accuses you of having
done so is a liar, and should be treated accordingly.  If you *do* understand
the memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then
you have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,
the only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:

	1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.
	2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.
	3: When replying to one of your own memos.

		<string>Frobnicate, v.:
	To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ. Usually
abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying &quot;to frob a frob.&quot; See TWEAK
and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along
a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross
manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes
fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he&apos;s
carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it
but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he&apos;s just
doing it because turning a knob is fun, he&apos;s frobbing it.

		<string>Frobnitz, pl. Frobnitzem (frob&apos;nitsm) n.:
	An unspecified physical object, a widget.  Also refers to electronic

Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBBOZ (fruh-bahz&apos;), pl. FROBBOTZIM, has also
become very popular, largely due to its exposure via the Adventure spin-off
called Zork (Dungeon).  These can also be applied to non-physical objects,
such as data structures.

	transfer to an uptown F, get off at East Broadway, walk north on

		<string>Lemma:  All horses are the same color.
Proof (by induction):
	Case n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all
	horses in that set are the same color.
	Case n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these
	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all
	of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you
	took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k
	horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses
	are all the same color.  We have k true =&gt; k+1 true; therefore all
	horses are the same color.
Theorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.
Proof (by intimidation):
	Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It
	is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in
	back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a

		<string>MAFIA, n:
	[Acronym for Mechanized Applications in Forced Insurance
Accounting.] An extensive network with many on-line and offshore
subsystems running under OS, DOS, and IOS.  MAFIA documentation is
rather scanty, and the MAFIA sales office exhibits that testy
reluctance to bona fide inquiries which is the hallmark of so many DP
operations.  From the little that has seeped out, it would appear that
MAFIA operates under a non-standard protocol, OMERTA, a tight-lipped
variant of SNA, in which extended handshakes also perform complex
security functions.  The known timesharing aspects of MAFIA point to a
more than usually autocratic operating system.  Screen prompts carry an
imperative, nonrefusable weighting (most menus offer simple YES/YES
options, defaulting to YES) that precludes indifference or delay.
Uniquely, all editing under MAFIA is performed centrally, using a
powerful rubout feature capable of erasing files, filors, filees, and
entire nodal aggravations.

(5) Therefore, horses must have an infinite number of legs.

		<string>Rules for Writers:
	Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.  Don&apos;t use no double
negatives.  Use the semicolon properly, always use it where it is appropriate;
and never where it isn&apos;t.  Reserve the apostrophe for it&apos;s proper use and
omit it when its not needed.  No sentence fragments. Avoid commas, that are
unnecessary.  Eschew dialect, irregardless.  And don&apos;t start a sentence with
a conjunction.  Hyphenate between sy-llables and avoid un-necessary hyphens.
Write all adverbial forms correct.  Don&apos;t use contractions in formal writing.
Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.  It is incumbent on
us to avoid archaisms.  Steer clear of incorrect forms of verbs that have
snuck in the language.  Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.  If I&apos;ve
told you once, I&apos;ve told you a thousand times, resist hyperbole.  Also,
avoid awkward or affected alliteration.  Don&apos;t string too many prepositional
phrases together unless you are walking through the valley of the shadow of
death.  &quot;Avoid overuse of &apos;quotation &quot;marks.&quot;&apos;&quot;

		<string>Theorem: All positive integers are equal.
Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.
	Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N &gt; 0, if A and B
	(positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.

Proceed by induction:
	If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1.
	So A = B.

Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with
	MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence
	(A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.

		<string>		William Safire&apos;s Rules for Writers:

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never be
used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to agree with
their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you reread
your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be
avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of
view.  And don&apos;t start a sentence with a conjunction.  (Remember, too, a
preposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.) Don&apos;t overuse
exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,
dangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of
a sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing
metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be
careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.
Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.  Last
but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable alternatives.

</string>
		<string>Anti-Victim Device:
	A small fashion accessory worn on an otherwise
conservative outfit which announces to the world that one still has a
spark of individuality burning inside: 1940s retro ties and earrings

		-- Douglas Coupland, &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture&quot;
</string>
		<string>Nutritional Slumming:
	Food whose enjoyment stems not from flavor but from a
complex mixture of class connotations, nostalgia signals, and
packaging semiotics: Katie and I bought this tub of Multi-Whip instead

Pensacola back in the early sixties would feed their husbands to
celebrate a career promotion.

		-- Douglas Coupland, &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture&quot;

		<string>QFM:

	Having children to make up for the fact that one no longer
believes in the future.
		-- Douglas Coupland, &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture&quot;
</string>
		<string>Squires:
	The most common X generation subgroup and the only subgroup
given to breeding.  Squires exist almost exclusively in couples and
are recognizable by their frantic attempts to create a semblance of
Eisenhower-era plenitude in their daily lives in the face of
exorbitant housing prices and two-job life-styles.  Squires tend to be
continually exhausted from their voraciously acquisitive pursuit of
furniture and knickknacks.

		<string>Underdogging:
	The tendency to almost invariably side with the underdog in a
given situation.  The consumer expression of this trait is the

looking up against all the other yuppie food items that I just had to
buy them.&quot;

</string>
		<string>2 + 2 = 5-ism:

		<string>Option Paralysis:
	The tendency, when given unlimited choices, to make none.
		-- Douglas Coupland, &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture&quot;
</string>
		<string>Personality Tithe:
	A price paid for becoming a couple; previously amusing
human beings become boring: &quot;Thanks for inviting us, but Noreen and I
are going to look at flatware catalogs tonight.  Afterward we&apos;re going
to watch the shopping channel.&quot;
		-- Douglas Coupland, &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture&quot;
</string>

		   Culture&quot;

		<string>A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head.  The
green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that
grew in the ears themselvse, stuck out on either side like turn signals
indicating two directions at once.  Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the
bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled
with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.  In the shadow under the green visor
of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly&apos;s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down
upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department
store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress.  Several
of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be
properly considered offenses against taste and decency.  Possession of
anything new or expensive only reflected a person&apos;s lack of theology and
geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one&apos;s soul.

		<string>A man is crawling through the Sahara desert when he is approached by another
man riding on a camel.  When the rider gets close enough, the crawling man
whispers through his sun-parched lips, &quot;Water... please... can you give...
water...&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; replies the man on the camel, &quot;I don&apos;t have any water
with me.  But I&apos;d be delighted to sell you a necktie.&quot;
	&quot;Tie?&quot; whispers the man.  &quot;I need *water*.&quot;
	&quot;They&apos;re only four dollars apiece.&quot;
	&quot;I need *water*.&quot;
	&quot;Okay, okay, say two for seven dollars.&quot;
	&quot;Please!  I need *water*!&quot;, says the man.
	&quot;I don&apos;t have any water, all I have are ties,&quot; replies the salesman,
and he heads off into the distance.
	The man, losing track of time, crawls for what seems like days.
Finally, nearly dead, sun-blind and with his skin peeling and blistering, he
sees a restaurant in the distance.  Summoning the last of his strength he
staggers up to the door and confronts the head waiter.
	&quot;Water... can I get... water,&quot; the dying man manages to stammer.
	&quot;I&apos;m sorry, sir, ties required.&quot;

		<string>	A young honeymoon couple were touring southern Florida and happened 
to stop at one of the rattlesnake farms along the road.  After seeing the 
sights, they engaged in small talk with the man that handled the snakes.
&quot;Gosh!&quot; exclaimed the new bride.  &quot;You certainly have a dangerous job.
Don&apos;t you ever get bitten by the snakes?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, upon rare occasions,&quot; answered the handler.
	&quot;Well,&quot; she continued, &quot;just what do you do when you&apos;re bitten by
a snake?&quot;
	&quot;I always carry a razor-sharp knife in my pocket, and as soon as I
am bitten, I make deep criss-cross marks across the fang entry and then
suck the poison from the wound.&quot;
	&quot;What, uh... what would happen if you were to accidentally *sit* on
a rattler?&quot; persisted the woman.
	&quot;Ma&apos;am,&quot; answered the snake handler, &quot;that will be the day I learn

		<string>An elderly couple were flying to their Caribbean hideaway on a chartered plane
when a terrible storm forced them to land on an uninhabited island.  When
several days passed without rescue, the couple and their pilot sank into a
despondent silence. Finally, the woman asked her husband if he had made his
usual pledge to the United Way Campaign.
	&quot;We&apos;re running out of food and water and you ask *that*?&quot; her husband
barked.  &quot;If you really need to know, I not only pledged a half million but
I&apos;ve already paid them half of it.&quot;

		<string>An excellence-oriented &apos;80s male does not wear a regular watch.  He wears
a Rolex watch, because it weighs nearly six pounds and is advertised
only in excellence-oriented publications such as Fortune and Rich
Protestant Golfer Magazine.  The advertisements are written in
incomplete sentences, which is how advertising copywriters denote excellence:

&quot;The Rolex Hyperion.  An elegant new standard in quality excellence and
discriminating handcraftsmanship.  For the individual who is truly able
to discriminate with regard to excellent quality standards of crafting
things by hand.  Fabricated of 100 percent 24-karat gold.  No watch parts
or anything.  Just a great big chunk on your wrist.  Truly a timeless
statement.  For the individual who is very secure.  Who doesn&apos;t need to
be reminded all the time that he is very successful. Much more successful
than the people who laughed at him in high school.  Because of his acne.
People who are probably nowhere near as successful as he is now.  Maybe
he&apos;ll go to his 20th reunion, and they&apos;ll see his Rolex Hyperion.

to them -- it is outrageous to have some outer authority tell you what is
proper use and abuse of your own faculties, and it is ludicrous to hold
reason higher than body or feeling.  Still there is something true and
profoundly sane about the belief that acts like murder or theft or
assault violate the doer as well as the done to.  We might even, if we
thought this way, have less crime.  The popular view of crime, as far as
I can deduce it from the movies and television, is that it is a breaking
of a rule by someone who thinks they can get away with that; implicitly,
everyone would like to break the rule, but not everyone is arrogant
enough to imagine they can get away with it.  It therefore becomes very
important for the rule upholders to bring such arrogance down.

		<string>	Eeyore, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and
looked at himself in the water.
	&quot;Pathetic,&quot; he said.  &quot;That&apos;s what it is.  Pathetic.&quot;
	He turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards,
splashed across it, and walked slowly back on the other side.  Then he
looked at himself again.
	&quot;As I thought,&quot; he said, &quot;no better from *____this* side.  But nobody
minds.  Nobody cares.  Pathetic, that&apos;s what it is.

		<string>	Everthing is farther away than it used to be.  It is even twice as
far to the corner and they have added a hill.  I have given up running for
the bus; it leaves earlier than it used to.
	It seems to me they are making the stairs steeper than in the old
days.  And have you noticed the smaller print they use in the newspapers?
	There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as everbody
speaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them.
	The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the hips
and waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one&apos;s shoelaces.  And the
sizes don&apos;t run the way they used to.  The 12&apos;s and 14&apos;s are so much smaller.
	Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used to
be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much older
than I am.
	I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so much
that she didn&apos;t recognize me.
	I got to thinking about the poor dear while I was combing my hair
this morning and in so doing I glanced at my own reflection.  Really now,
they don&apos;t even make good mirrors like they used to.

		<string>Every man is apt to form his notions of things difficult to be apprehended,
or less familiar, from their analogy to things which are more familiar.
Thus, if a man bred to the seafaring life, and accustomed to think and talk
only of matters relating to navigation, enters into discourse upon any other
subject; it is well known, that the language and the notions proper to his
own profession are infused into every subject, and all things are measured
by the rules of navigation: and if he should take it into his head to
philosophize concerning the faculties of the mind, it cannot be doubted,
but he would draw his notions from the fabric of the ship, and would find
in the mind, sails, masts, rudder, and compass.

		<string>	I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments
of others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, such
as &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I conceive&quot;,
&quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it appears to me
at present&quot;.
	When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him
immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by
observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,
but in the present case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.
	I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the
conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I
proposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.
I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.

		<string>I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of

crude.  I&apos;m a very technical boy.  So I decided to get as crude as possible.
These days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even

		<string>Largest Number of Driving Test Failures
	By April 1970 Mrs. Miriam Hargrave had failed her test thirty-nine
times.  In the eight preceding years she had received two hundred and
twelve driving lessons at a cost of L300.  She set the new record while
driving triumphantly through a set of red traffic lights in Wakefield,
Yorkshire.  Disappointingly, she passed at the fortieth attempt (3 August
1970) but eight years later she showed some of her old magic when she was
reported as saying that she still didn&apos;t like doing right-hand turns.

into the saloon.  As he made his way through the crowd to the bar, a man
galloped through town screaming, &quot;Big Mike&apos;s comin&apos;!  Run fer yer lives!&quot;
	Suddenly, the saloon doors burst open.  An enormous man, standing over
eight feet tall and weighing an easy 400 pounds, rode in on a bull, using a
rattlesnake for a whip.  Grabbing the drifter by the arm and throwing him over
the bar, the giant thundered, &quot;Gimme a drink!&quot;
	The terrified man handed over a bottle of whiskey, which the man
guzzled in one gulp and then smashed on the bar.  He then stood aghast as
the man stuffed the broken bottle in his mouth, munched broken glass and
smacked his lips with relish.
	&quot;Can I, ah, uh, get you another, sir?&quot; the drifter stammered.
	&quot;Naw, I gotta git outa here, boy,&quot; the man grunted.  &quot;Big Mike&apos;s
a-comin&apos;.&quot;

		<string>Many mental processes admit of being roughly measured.  For instance,
the degree to which people are bored, by counting the number of their
fidgets. I not infrequently tried this method at the meetings of the
Royal Geographical Society, for even there dull memoirs are occasionally
read.  [...]  The use of a watch attracts attention, so I reckon time
by the number of my breathings, of which there are 15 in a minute.  They
are not counted mentally, but are punctuated by pressing with 15 fingers
successively.  The counting is reserved for the fidgets.  These observations
should be confined to persons of middle age.  Children are rarely still,
while elderly philosophers will sometimes remain rigid for minutes altogether.

		<string>One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with
Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just
to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn&apos;t
be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending
to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn&apos;t
understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was
reknowned for being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the
time, which obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be
puzzled rather than contemptuous.  This above all appeared to Trillian to be
genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

		<string>People (a group that in my opinion has always attracted an undue amount of

suggest that each is unique -- no two alike.  This is quite patently not the

only similarity to snowflakes resides in their invariable and lamentable
tendency to turn, after a few warm days, to slush.

		<string>	&quot;Richard, in being so fierce toward my vampire, you were doing
what you wanted to do, even though you thought it was going to hurt

	&quot;Which is what we do to anyone when we tell them we&apos;ll be hurt
if they don&apos;t live our way.&quot;
...
	&quot;The thing that puzzles you,&quot; he said, &quot;is an accepted saying that
happens to be impossible.  The phrase is hurt somebody else.  We choose,
ourselves, to be hurt or not to be hurt, no matter what.  Us who decides.
Nobody else.  My vampire told you he&apos;d be hurt if you didn&apos;t let him?  That&apos;s
his decision to be hurt, that&apos;s his choice.  What you do about it is your
decision, your choice: give him blood; ignore him; tie him up; drive a stake
through his heart.  If he doesn&apos;t want the holly stake, he&apos;s free to resist,
in whatever way he wants.  It goes on and on, choices, choices.&quot;
	&quot;When you look at it that way...&quot;

	something larger.  Like ... Wyoming.
 4 (personal): Well, here we are.  Just the three of us.
 5 (punctual): Alright gentlemen.  Your nose was on time but you were fifteen

 7 (naughty): Pardon me, Sir.  Some of the ladies have asked if you wouldn&apos;t

 8 (philosophical): You know.  It&apos;s not the size of a nose that&apos;s important.
	It&apos;s what&apos;s in it that matters.
 9 (humorous): Laugh and the world laughs with you.  Sneeze and it&apos;s goodbye,

10 (commercial): Hi, I&apos;m Earl Schibe and I can paint that nose for $39.95.

16 (obscure): Oh, I&apos;d hate to see the grindstone.
17 (inquiry): When you stop to smell the flowers, are they afraid?

		<string>The heroic hours of life do not announce their presence by drum and trumpet,
challenging us to be true to ourselves by appeals to the martial spirit that
keeps the blood at heat.  Some little, unassuming, unobtrusive choice presents
itself before us slyly and craftily, glib and insinuating, in the modest garb

He creates himself by fashoning his own values; he has the pride to live

	The man&apos;s younger brother, who had been facing reality and all his
problems for 50 years with psychiatrists, nervous breakdowns, tics, tension,

		<string>Violence stinks, no matter which end of it you&apos;re on.  But now and then
there&apos;s nothing left to do but hit the other person over the head with a
frying pan.  Sometimes people are just begging for that frypan, and if we

shapes of the delightful human tadpole, the horizon would not wear so wide
a grin.
		-- F.M. Colby, &quot;Imaginary Obligations&quot;
</string>
		<string>What do I consider a reasonable person to be?  I&apos;d say a reasonable person
is one who accepts that we are all human and therefore fallible, and takes
that into account when dealing with others.  Implicit in this definition is
the belief that it is the right and the responsibility of each person to
live his or her own life as he or she sees fit, to respect this right in
others, and to demand the assumption of this responsibility by others.

		<string>What good is it if you talk in flowers, and they think in pastry?

</string>
		<string>	What is involved in such [close] relationships is a form of emotional
chemistry, so far unexplained by any school of psychiatry I am aware of, that
conditions nothing so simple as a choice between the poles of attraction and
repulsion.  You can meet some people thirty, forty times down the years, and
they remain amiable bystanders, like the shore lights of towns that a sailor
passes at stated times but never calls at on the regular run.  Conversely,
all considerations of sex aside, you can meet some other people once or twice
and they remain permanent influences on your life.
	Everyone is aware of this discrepancy between the acquaintance seen
as familiar wallpaper or instant friend.  The chemical action it entails is
less worth analyzing than enjoying.  At any rate, these six pieces are about
men with whom I felt an immediate sympat - to use a coining of Max Beerbohm&apos;s
more satisfactory to me than the opaque vogue word &quot;empathy&quot;.

</string>
		<string>What makes us so bitter against people who outwit us is that they think
themselves cleverer than we are.

		<string>What we see depends on mainly what we look for.
		-- John Lubbock
</string>
		<string>What you see is from outside yourself, and may come, or not, but is beyond
your control.  But your fear is yours, and yours alone, like your voice, or
your fingers, or your memory, and therefore yours to control.  If you feel
powerless over your fear, you have not yet admitted that it is yours, to do
with as you will.

		<string>When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his
mind wonderfully.
		-- Samuel Johnson
</string>
		<string>When a man you like switches from what he said a year ago, or four years
ago, he is a broad-minded man who has courage enough to change his mind
with changing conditions.  When a man you don&apos;t like does it, he is a
liar who has broken his promises.

</string>
		<string>When among apes, one must play the ape.

is to believe the one in which people appear at their worst.

your feet.
		-- Stanislaw Lem, &quot;Unkempt Thoughts&quot;
</string>
		<string>When you speak to others for their own good it&apos;s advice;
when they speak to you for your own good it&apos;s interference.
</string>
		<string>When you try to make an impression, the chances are that is the
impression you will make.
</string>
		<string>WHENEVER ANYBODY SAYS he&apos;s struggling to become a human being I have to
laugh because the apes beat him to it by about a million years.  Struggle
to become a parrot or something.

</string>
		<string>Whenever someone tells you to take their advice, you can be pretty sure
that they&apos;re not using it.

spend a life knowing exactly what you want and that you will never have it.
		-- Richard Shelton

		<string>While anyone can admit to themselves they were wrong, the true test is
admission to someone else.

become a monster.  And when you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks
into you.

</string>
		<string>Whoever would lie usefully should lie seldom.
</string>
		<string>Why be difficult when, with a bit of effort, you could be impossible?

		<string>Young men are fitter to invent than to judge; fitter for execution than for
counsel; and fitter for new projects than for settled business.  For the
experience of age, in things that fall within the compass of it, directeth
them; but in new things, abuseth them.  The errors of young men are the ruin
of business; but the errors of aged men amount but to this, that more might
have been done, or sooner.  Young men, in the conduct and management of
actions, embrace more than they can hold; stir more than they can quiet; fly
to the end, without consideration of the means and degrees; pursue some few
principles which they have chanced upon absurdly; care not how they innovate,
which draws unknown inconveniences; and, that which doubleth all errors, will
not acknowledge or retract them; like an unready horse, that will neither stop
nor turn.  Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little,
repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, but
content themselves with a mediocrity of success.  Certainly, it is good to
compound employments of both ... because the virtues of either age may correct
the defects of both.

		<string>Your Co-worker Could Be a Space Alien, Say Experts
		...Here&apos;s How You Can Tell
Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human -- but you
can spot these visitors by looking for certain tip-offs, say experts. They
listed 10 signs to watch for:
    (3) Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don&apos;t understand
	earthly humor may laugh during a company training film or tell
	jokes that no one understands, said Steiger.
    (6) Misuses everyday items.  &quot;A space alien may use correction
	fluid to paint its nails,&quot; said Steiger.
    (8) Secretive about personal life-style and home.  &quot;An alien won&apos;t
	discuss details or talk about what it does at night or on weekends.&quot;
   (10) Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near certain
	high-tech hardware.  &quot;An alien may experience a mood change when
	a microwave oven is turned on,&quot; said Steiger.
The experts pointed out that a co-worker would have to display most if not
all of these traits before you can positively identify him as a space alien.

		<string>Your conscience never stops you from doing anything.  It just stops you

		<string>Your friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your
acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.
		-- Richard Bach, &quot;Illusions&quot;

		<string>Youth -- not a time of life but a state of mind... a predominance of
courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.
		-- Robert F. Kennedy
</string>
		<string>Youth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a regret.
		-- Benjamin Disraeli, &quot;Coningsby&quot;
</string>
		<string>Youth is a disease from which we all recover.
		-- Dorothy Fuldheim
</string>
		<string>	Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind; it is a temper of
the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a predominance
of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease.
	Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years; people grow
old only by deserting their ideals.  Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up
enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.  Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear, and despair
-- these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit
back to dust.
	Whether seventy or sixteen, there is in every being&apos;s heart the love
of wonder, the sweet amazement at the stars and the starlike things and
thoughts, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite
for what next, and the joy and the game of life.
	You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your
self-confidence, as old as your fear, as young as your hope, as old as your
despair.
	So long as your heart receives messages of beauty, cheer, courage,
grandeur and power from the earth, from man, and from the Infinite, so long
you are young.
		-- Samuel Ullman

		<string>When you are in the middle of a story it isn&apos;t a story at all, but
only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered

powerless to stop it.  It&apos;s only afterwards that it becomes anything
like a story at all.  When you are telling it, to yourself or to

Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack you, caring nothing for the fact
that in bulk and strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the earth

afraid than is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by
an earthquake ten centuries before.  When we speak of Clive, Nelson, and Putnam

thou has dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper sun now gleams has
moved amid the world&apos;s foundations.  Where unrecorded names and navies rust,
and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate
earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful
water-land, there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or
diver never went; has slept by many a sailer&apos;s side, where sleepless mothers
would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw&apos;st the locked lovers when
leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting
wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.  Thou saw&apos;st the
murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell
into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed
on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would
have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.  O head! thou has

		<string>The Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is held ever year at San Jose State
Univ.  by Professor Scott Rice.  It is held in memory of Edward George
Earle Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), a rather prolific and popular (in his
time) novelist.  He is best known today for having written &quot;The Last
Days of Pompeii.&quot;

Whenever Snoopy starts typing his novel from the top of his doghouse,
beginning &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot; he is borrowing from Lord
Bulwer-Lytton.  This was the line that opened his novel, &quot;Paul Clifford,&quot;
written in 1830.  The full line reveals why it is so bad:

	It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents -- except
	at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of
	wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene
	lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty
	flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

		<string>The Least Perceptive Literary Critic
	The most important critic in our field of study is Lord Halifax.  A
most individual judge of poetry, he once invited Alexander Pope round to
give a public reading of his latest poem.
	Pope, the leading poet of his day, was greatly surprised when Lord
Halifax stopped him four or five times and said, &quot;I beg your pardon, Mr.
Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me.&quot;
	Pope was rendered speechless, as this fine critic suggested sizeable
and unwise emendations to his latest masterpiece.  &quot;Be so good as to mark
the place and consider at your leisure.  I&apos;m sure you can give it a better
turn.&quot;
	After the reading, a good friend of Lord Halifax, a certain Dr.
Garth, took the stunned Pope to one side.  &quot;There is no need to touch the
lines,&quot; he said.  &quot;All you need do is leave them just as they are, call on
Lord Halifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observation
on those passages, and then read them to him as altered.  I have known him
much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event.&quot;
	Pope took his advice, called on Lord Halifax and read the poem
exactly as it was before.  His unique critical faculties had lost none of
their edge.  &quot;Ay&quot;, he commented, &quot;now they are perfectly right.  Nothing can
be better.&quot;

		<string>The Least Successful Collector
	Betsy Baker played a central role in the history of collecting.  She
was employed as a servant in the house of John Warburton (1682-1759) who had
amassed a fine collection of 58 first edition plays, including most of the
works of Shakespeare.
	One day Warburton returned home to find 55 of them charred beyond
legibility.  Betsy had either burned them or used them as pie bottoms.  The
remaining three folios are now in the British Museum.
	The only comparable literary figure was the maid who in 1835 burned
the manuscript of the first volume of Thomas Carlyle&apos;s &quot;The Hisory of the
French Revolution&quot;, thinking it was wastepaper.

		<string>We were young and our happiness dazzled us with its strength.  But there was
also a terrible betrayal that lay within me like a Merle Haggard song at a
French restaurant. [...]
	I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her milk
white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I had punched her
boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told him, &quot;You ride the
bull, senor.  You do not fight it.&quot;  But he was lean and tough like a bad
rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought me.  And when we finished
there were no winners, just men doing what men must do. [...]
	&quot;Stop the car,&quot; the girl said.
	There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about the
woman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to speak, but she raised an
arm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will never forget.
	&quot;I do not ask for whom&apos;s the tollway belle,&quot; she said, &quot;the tollway
belle&apos;s for thee.&quot;

		<string>Well, anyway, I was reading this James Bond book, and right away I realized
that like most books, it had too many words.  The plot was the same one that
all James Bond books have: An evil person tries to blow up the world, but
James Bond kills him and his henchmen and makes love to several attractive
women.  There, that&apos;s it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took
*thousands* of words to say it.
	Or consider &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, by the famous Russian alcoholic
Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  It&apos;s about these two brothers who kill their father.
Or maybe only one of them kills the father.  It&apos;s impossible to tell because
what they mostly do is talk for nearly a thousand pages.  If all Russians talk
as much as the Karamazovs did, I don&apos;t see how they found time to become a
major world power.
	I&apos;m told that Dostoyevsky wrote &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; to raise
the question of whether there is a God.  So why didn&apos;t he just come right
out and say: &quot;Is there a God? It sure beats the heck out of me.&quot;
	Other famous works could easily have been summarized in a few words:

		<string>You see, I consider that a man&apos;s brain originally is like a little empty

takes in all the lumber of every sort he comes across, so that the knowledge
which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with
a lot of other things, so that he has difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his
brain-attic.  He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing
his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect
order.  It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and
can distend to any extent.  Depend upon it there comes a time when for every
addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before.  It is of

		<string>&quot;Good afternoon, madam.  How may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon.  I&apos;d like a FrintArms HandCannon, please.&quot;

&quot;A--?  Oh, now, that&apos;s an awfully big gun for such a lovely lady.  I
mean, not everybody thinks ladies should carry guns at all, though I
say they have a right to.  But I think... I might... Let&apos;s have a look
down here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!
Look at that, isn&apos;t it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,
but it&apos;s what&apos;s called a laser -- a light-pistol some people call
them.  Very small, as you see; fits easily into a pocket or bag; won&apos;t
spoil the line of a jacket; and you won&apos;t feel you&apos;re lugging half a
tonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,
including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I
got to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  And
there&apos;s *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,
charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster
with adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your
next battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free
lessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there&apos;s the *special*
presentation pack; it has all the other one&apos;s got but with *two*
charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don&apos;t
worry, it&apos;s a dummy battery -- isn&apos;t it neat?  Feel how light it is?
Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*
beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there&apos;s
no recoil.  Because it&apos;s shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,
beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That&apos;s not a line, she
really has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free
charge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special
offer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for
one-forty-nine.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;ll take the special.&quot;

&quot;Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?&quot;

&quot;And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, three
six-five AP/wire-fl&apos;echettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and a
Special Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embedding
rounds, not the signalers.  I assume the night-sight on this toy is
compatible?&quot;

&quot;Aah... yes,  And how does madam wish to pay?&quot;

She slapped her credit card on the counter.  &quot;Eventually.&quot;

unimpeachable.  The judges&apos; decisions based on it were sound in logic and

		<string>[District Attorneys] learn in District Attorney School that there are
two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable publicity:

(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    factory puts them there.
(2) Raid an &quot;adult book store&quot; and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A juror at a pornography trial is not about to
    state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
    where actors engage in sexual activities with live snakes and a
    fire extinguisher.  He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and
    vote for the death penalty just to make sure nobody gets the wrong

But the south-east Victorian town of Sale has produced one to top them all.
Dial-A-Wombat.
	It all began early yesterday when Sale police received a telephone
call: &quot;You won&apos;t believe this, and I&apos;m not drunk, but there&apos;s a wombat in the
phone booth outside the town hall,&quot; the caller said.
	Not firmly convinced about the caller&apos;s claim to sobriety, members of
the constabulary drove to the scene, expecting to pick up a drunk.
	But there it was, an annoyed wombat, trapped in a telephone booth.
	The wombat, determined not to be had the better of again, threw its
bulk into the fray. It was eventually lassoed and released in a nearby scrub.
	Then the officers received another message ... another wombat in
another phone booth.
	There it was: *Another* angry wombat trapped in a telephone booth.
	The constables took the miffed marsupial into temporary custody and
released it, too, in the scrub.
	But on their way back to the station they happened to pass another
telephone booth, and -- you guessed it -- another imprisoned wombat.
	After some serious detective work, the lads in blue found a suspect,
and after questioning, released him to be charged on summons.
	Their problem ... they cannot find a law against placing wombats in
telephone booths.

was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of The Management Group, Inc.
Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
Connellan attributed a measure of America&apos;s falling productivity to an excess
of attorneys and accountants, and a dearth of production experts.  Lawyers
and accountants &quot;do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure
out how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value
to product.&quot;
	According to Connellan, the highly productive Japanese society has
10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.  The U.S. has 200
lawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests that &quot;the U.S. proportion of

(10) Potholes are

	(a) extremely dangerous.
	(b) patriotic.
	(c) the fault of the previous administration.
	(d) all going to be fixed next summer.

The correct answer is (b). Potholes destroy unpatriotic, unamerican,
imported cars, since the holes are larger than the cars.  If you drive a
big, patriotic, American car you have nothing to worry about.
</string>

you test it?

	(a) once a year.
	(b) once a month.
	(c) once a day.
	(d) once an hour.

		<string>			Pittsburgh Driver&apos;s Test

(7) The car directly in front of you has a flashing right tail light
    but a steady left tail light.  This means

	(a) one of the tail lights is broken; you should blow your horn
	    to call the problem to the driver&apos;s attention.
	(b) the driver is signaling a right turn.
	(c) the driver is signaling a left turn.
	(d) the driver is from out of town.

(8) Pedestrians are

	(a) irrelevant.
	(b) communists.

(9) Roads are salted in order to

	(a) kill grass.
	(b) melt snow.
	(c) help the economy.
	(d) prevent potholes.

The correct answer is (c). Road salting employs thousands of persons
directly, and millions more indirectly, for example, salt miners and
rustproofers.  Most important, salting reduces the life spans of cars,
thus stimulating the car and steel industries.

		<string>Some of the most interesting documents from Sweden&apos;s middle ages are the

the Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, thinly covered with some
Christian stuff.  In this law, we find a page about &quot;lekare&quot;, which is the
Old Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is
an approximate translation, where I have written &quot;artist&quot; as equivalent of
&quot;lekare&quot;.
	&quot;If an artist is beaten, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist
	is wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with
	fiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring
	it out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the
	heifer&apos;s tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given
	newly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer&apos;s tail,
	and a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he
	shall have the animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what
	he received, shame and wounds.&quot;

		<string>The justifications for drug testing are part of the presently fashionable
debate concerning restoring America&apos;s &quot;competitiveness.&quot; Drugs, it has been
revealed, are responsible for rampant absenteeism, reduced output, and poor
quality work.  But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the
resurrection of competitiveness?  Will charging the atmosphere of the
workplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity?
Much noise has been made about rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but
to date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or the not
hiring of the abuser.  This practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, the
nation&apos;s productivity problem.  If economic rehabilitation is the ultimate
goal of drug testing, then criteria abandoning the rehabilitation of the
drug-using worker is the purest of hypocrisy and the worst of rationalization.

the lack of learning combined with sound common sense is more helpful than
the kind of cleverness that gets out of hand, and that as a general rule,
states are better governed by the man in the street than by intellectuals.
These are the sort of people who want to appear wiser than the laws, who
want to get their own way in every general discussion, because they feel that
they cannot show off their intelligence in matters of greater importance, and
who, as a result, very often bring ruin on their country.

by suing you for causing his subsequent paraplegia and seek to force you

that he was depressed because society had failed him, and that he was
looking for Mother Teresa for comfort and to offer his services to the
poor.  In that lawsuit, you will lose.  If, on the other hand, you kill
him, the most that you can expect is that a relative will bring a wrongful

		<string>If you have received a letter inviting you to speak at the dedication of a
new cat hospital, and you hate cats, your reply, declining the invitation,
does not necessarily have to cover the full range of your emotions.  You must
make it clear that you will not attend, but you do not have to let fly at cats.
The writer of the letter asked a civil question; attack cats, then, only if
you can do so with good humor, good taste, and in such a way that your answer
will be courteous as well as responsive.  Since you are out of sympathy with
cats, you may quite properly give this as a reason for not appearing at the
dedication ceremonies of a cat hospital.  But bear in mind that your opinion
of cats was not sought, only your services as a speaker.  Try to keep things
straight.

		<string>A fellow bought a new car, a Nissan, and was quite happy with his purchase.
He was something of an animist, however, and felt that the car really ought
to have a name.  This presented a problem, as he was not sure if the name
should be masculine or feminine.
	After considerable thought, he settled on an naming the car either
Belchazar or Beaumadine, but remained in a quandry about the final choice.
	&quot;Is a Nissan male or female?&quot; he began asking his friends.  Most of
them looked at him pecularly, mumbled things about urgent appointments, and
went on their way rather quickly.
	He finally broached the question to a lady he knew who held a black
belt in judo.  She thought for a moment and answered &quot;Feminine.&quot;
	The swiftness of her response puzzled him. &quot;You&apos;re sure of that?&quot; he
asked.
	&quot;Certainly,&quot; she replied. &quot;They wouldn&apos;t sell very well if they were
masculine.&quot;
	&quot;Unhhh...  Well, why not?&quot;
	&quot;Because people want a car with a reputation for going when you want
it to.  And, if Nissan&apos;s are female, it&apos;s like they say...  `Each Nissan, she
go!&apos;&quot;

		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

1. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.
	Involvement with the patient&apos;s suffering might cause him to lose
	valuable scientific objectivity.

2. BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.
	Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the
	gentleness and reassurance he can get.

3. TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.
	Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.
</string>
		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

4. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
	You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into
	the true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent
	disability you may have experienced.

5. NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.
	It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be
	explained in terms that you would understand.

6. SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMANTAL TREATMENT READILY.
	Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting
	research paper will surely be of widespread interest.
</string>
		<string>A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

7. PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.
	You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly,
	to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.

8. DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
	It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.

9. NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE
   OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
	The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a
	sacred duty to protect him from exposure.

10. NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR&apos;S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.
	This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.

		<string>A distraught patient phoned her doctor&apos;s office.  &quot;Was it true,&quot; the woman
inquired, &quot;that the medication the doctor had prescribed was for the rest
of her life?&quot;
	She was told that it was.  There was just a moment of silence before
the woman proceeded bravely on.  &quot;Well, I&apos;m wondering, then, how serious my
condition is.  This prescription is marked `NO REFILLS&apos;&quot;.

		<string>A doctor calls his patient to give him the results of his tests.  &quot;I have
some bad news,&quot; says the doctor, &quot;and some worse news.&quot;  The bad news is
that you only have six weeks to live.&quot;
	&quot;Oh, no,&quot; says the patient.  &quot;What could possibly be worse than that?&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor replies, &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to reach you since
last Monday.&quot;

		<string>A woman went into a hospital one day to give birth.  Afterwards, the doctor
came to her and said, &quot;I have some... odd news for you.&quot;
	&quot;Is my baby all right?&quot; the woman anxiously asked.
	&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; the doctor replied, &quot;but we don&apos;t know how.  Your son
(we assume) was born with no body.  He only has a head.&quot;
	Well, the doctor was correct.  The Head was alive and well, though no
one knew how.  The Head turned out to be fairly normal, ignoring his lack of
a body, and lived for some time as typical a life as could be expected under
the circumstances.
	One day, about twenty years after the fateful birth, the woman got a
phone call from another doctor.  The doctor said, &quot;I have recently perfected
an operation.  Your son can live a normal life now: we can graft a body onto
his head!&quot;
	The woman, practically weeping with joy, thanked the doctor and hung
up.  She ran up the stairs saying, &quot;Johnny, Johnny, I have a *wonderful*
surprise for you!&quot;
	&quot;Oh no,&quot; cried The Head, &quot;not another HAT!&quot;

		<string>After his legs had been broken in an accident, Mr. Miller sued for damages, 
claming that he was crippled and would have to spend the rest of his life
in a wheelchair.  Although the insurance-company doctor testified that his
bones had healed properly and that he was fully capable  of walking, the
judge decided for the plaintiff and awarded him $500,000.
	When he was wheeled into the insurance office to collect his check,
Miller was confronted by several executives.  &quot;You&apos;re not getting away with
this, Miller,&quot; one said.  &quot;We&apos;re going to watch you day and night.  If you
take a single step, you&apos;ll not only repay the damages but stand trial for
perjury.  Here&apos;s the money.  What do you intend to do with it?&quot;
	&quot;My wife and I are going to travel,&quot; Miller replied.  &quot;We&apos;ll go to
Stockholm, Berlin, Rome, Athens and, finally, to a place called Lourdes --
where, gentlemen, you&apos;ll see yourselves one hell of a miracle.&quot;

		<string>Aquavit is also considered useful for medicinal purposes, an essential

		<string>	As a general rule of thumb, never trust anybody who&apos;s been in therapy
for more than 15 percent of their life span.  The words &quot;I am sorry&quot; and &quot;I
am wrong&quot; will have totally disappeared from their vocabulary.  They will stab
you, shoot you, break things in your apartment, say horrible things to your
friends and family, and then justify this abhorrent behavior by saying:
&quot;Sure, I put your dog in the microwave.  But I feel *better* for doing it.&quot;

		<string>At the hospital, a doctor is training an intern on how to announce bad news
to the patients.  The doctor tells the intern &quot;This man in 305 is going to
die in six months.  Go in and tell him.&quot;  The intern boldly walks into the
room, over to the man&apos;s bedisde and tells him &quot;Seems like you&apos;re gonna die!&quot;
The man has a heart attack and is rushed into surgery on the spot.  The doctor
grabs the intern and screams at him, &quot;What!?!? are you some kind of moron?
You&apos;ve got to take it easy, work your way up to the subject.  Now this man in
213 has about a week to live.  Go in and tell him, but, gently, you hear me,
gently!&quot;
	The intern goes softly into the room, humming to himself, cheerily
opens the drapes to let the sun in, walks over to the man&apos;s bedside, fluffs
his pillow and wishes him a &quot;Good morning!&quot;  &quot;Wonderful day, no?  Say...
guess who&apos;s going to die soon!&quot;

    quietly at your desk at work.  People will suspect manic tendencies as
    you twitter around in your chair.

7.  Locking four people in a tiny, cement-walled room so they can run around
    for an hour smashing a little rubber ball -- and each other -- with a hard
    racket should immediately be recognized for what it is: a form of insanity.
8.  Fifty push-ups, followed by thirty sit-ups, followed by ten chin-ups,
    followed by one throw-up.

		<string>[From an announcement of a congress of the International Ontopsychology

The Ontopsychological school, availing itself of new research criteria and
of a new telematic epistemology, maintains that social modes do not spring
from dialectics of territory or of class, or of consumer goods, or of means
of power, but rather from dynamic latencies capillarized in millions of
individuals in system functions which, once they have reached the event
maturation, burst forth in catastrophic phenomenology engaging a suitable
stereotype protagonist or duty marionette (general, president, political
party, etc.) to consummate the act of social schizophrenia in mass genocide.

Illness is always an interaction between both.  It can begin in the mind and
affect the body, or it can begin in the body and affect the mind, both of
which are served by the same bloodstream.  Attempts to treat most mental
diseases as though they were completely free of physical causes and attempts
to treat most bodily diseases as though the mind were in no way involved must
be considered archaic in the light of new evidence about the way the human

your teeth hurt, and (b) you lack the strength.  Midway through the brushing
process, you&apos;d have to lie down in front of the sink to rest for a couple

Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
&quot;What writest thou?&quot;  The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, &quot;The names of those who love the Lord.&quot;
&quot;And is mine one?&quot; said Abou. &quot;Nay not so,&quot;
Replied the angel.  Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, &quot;I pray thee then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.&quot;
The angel wrote, and vanished.  The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo!  Ben Adhem&apos;s name led all the rest.

		<string>After a while you learn the subtle difference
Between holding a hand and chaining a soul,
And you learn that love doesn&apos;t mean security,
And you begin to learn that kisses aren&apos;t contracts
And presents aren&apos;t promises
And you begin to accept your defeats
With your head up and your eyes open,
With the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child,
And you learn to build all your roads
On today because tomorrow&apos;s ground
Is too uncertain.  And futures have
A way of falling down in midflight,
After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much.
So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting
For someone to bring you flowers.
And you learn that you really can endure...
That you really are strong,
And you really do have worth
And you learn and learn
With every goodbye you learn.

Tin&apos;uviel!  Tin&apos;uviel!
He called her by her elvish name;
And there she halted listening.
One moment stood she, and a spell
His voice laid on her: Beren came
And doom fell on Tin&apos;uviel
That in his arms lay glistening.

As Beren looked into her eyes
Within the shadows of her hair,
The trembling starlight of the skies
He saw there mirrored shimmering.
Tin&apos;uviel the elven-fair,
Immortal maiden elven-wise,
About him cast her shadowy hair
And arms like silver glimmering.

Long was the way that fate them bore,
O&apos;er stony mountains cold and grey,
Through halls of iron and darkling door,
And woods of nightshade morrowless.
The Sundering Seas between them lay,
And yet at last they met once more,
And long ago they passed away
In the forest singing sorrowless.

		<string>			Against Idleness and Mischief

How doth the little busy bee		How skillfully she builds her cell!
Improve each shining hour,		How neat she spreads the wax!
And gather honey all the day		And labours hard to store it well
From every opening flower!		With the sweet food she makes.

In works of labour or of skill		In books, or work, or healthful play,
I would be busy too;			Let my first years be passed,
For Satan finds some mischief still	That I may give for every day
For idle hands to do.			Some good account at last.

		<string>An Hacker there was, one of the finest sort
Who controlled the system; graphics was his sport.
A manly man, to be a wizard able;
Many a protected file he had sitting on his table.
His console, when he typed, a man might hear
Clicking and feeping wind as clear,
Aye, and as loud as does the machine room bell
Where my lord Hacker was Prior of the cell.
The Rule of good St Savage or St Doeppnor
As old and strict he tended to ignore;
He let go by the things of yesterday
And took the modern world&apos;s more spacious way.
He did not rate that text as a plucked hen
Which says that Hackers are not holy men.
And that a hacker underworked is a mere
Fish out of water, flapping on the pier.
That is to say, a hacker out of his cloister.
That was a text he held not worth an oyster.
And I agreed and said his views were sound;
Was he to study till his head wend round
Poring over books in the cloisters?  Must he toil
As Andy bade and till the very soil?
Was he to leave the world upon the shelf?
Let Andy have his labor to himself!

And we will some new pleasures prove
Of golden sands and crystal brooks
With silken lines, and silver hooks.
There&apos;s nothing that I wouldn&apos;t do
If you would be my POSSLQ.

You live with me, and I with you,
And you will be my POSSLQ.
I&apos;ll be your friend and so much more;
That&apos;s what a POSSLQ is for.

And everything we will confess;
Yes, even to the IRS.
Some day on what we both may earn,
Perhaps we&apos;ll file a joint return.
You&apos;ll share my pad, my taxes, joint;
You&apos;ll share my life - up to a point!
And that you&apos;ll be so glad to do,
Because you&apos;ll be my POSSLQ.

Catholic girls start much too late,
Ah, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate,
I might as well be the one.
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray,
Built you a temple and locked you away,

Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,
Stop up the access and passage to remorse
That no compunctious visiting of nature
Shake my fell purpose, not keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman&apos;s breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature&apos;s mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall the in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry `Hold, hold!&apos;

		<string>Felix Catus is your taxonomic nomenclature,
An endothermic quadroped, carnivorous by nature.
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses
Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.
I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal oscillations,
A singular development of cat communications
That obviates your basic hedonistic predelection
For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.
A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents:
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance;
And when not being utilitized to aid in locomotion,
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.
Oh Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display
Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.

And gave him the boot to larn him.

Would be the way to larn him.

But harder than stone is the flesh and bone
Of a troll that sits in the hills alone.
As well set your boot to the mountain&apos;s root,
For the seat of a troll don&apos;t feel it.

Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,
And he knew his toes could feel it.

Tom&apos;s leg is game, since home he came,
And his bootless foot is lasting lame;
But Troll don&apos;t care, and he&apos;s still there
With the bone he boned from its owner.

Troll&apos;s old seat is still the same,
And the bone he boned from its owner!

		<string>	Hack placidly amidst the noisy printers and remember what prizes there
may be in Science.  As fast as possible get a good terminal on a good system.
Enter your data clearly but always encrypt your results.  And listen to others,
even the dull and ignorant, for they may be your customers.  Avoid loud and
aggressive persons, for they are sales reps.
	If you compare your outputs with those of others, you may be surprised,
for always there will be greater and lesser numbers than you have crunched.
Keep others interested in your career, and try not to fumble; it can be a real
hassle and could change your fortunes in time.
	Exercise system control in your experiments, for the world is full of
bugs.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive
for linearity and everywhere papers are full of approximations.  Strive for
proportionality.  Especially, do not faint when it occurs.  Neither be cyclical
about results; for in the face of all data analysis it is sure to be noticed.
	Take with a grain of salt the anomalous data points.  Gracefully pass
them on to the youth at the next desk.  Nurture some mutual funds to shield
you in times of sudden layoffs.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings
-- the real bugs are enough to screw you badly.  Murphy&apos;s Law runs the
Universe -- and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt &lt;Curl&gt;B*n dS = 0.
	Therefore, grab for a piece of the pie, with whatever proposals you
can conceive of to try.  With all the crashed disks, skewed data, and broken
line printers, you can still have a beautiful secretary.  Be linear.  Strive
to stay employed.

		<string>He heard there oft the flying sound
Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
Of music welling underground,
In hidden hollows quavering.
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,
And one by one with sighing sound
Whispering fell the beechen leaves
In the wintry woodland wavering.

He sought her ever, wandering far
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,
By light of moon and ray of star
In frosty heavens shivering.
Her mantle glinted in the moon,
As on a hill-top high and far
She danced, and at her feet was strewn
A mist of silver quivering.

When winter passed, she came again,
And her song released the sudden spring,
Like rising lark, and falling rain,
And melting water bubbling.
He saw the elven-flowers spring
About her feet, and healed again
He longed by her to dance and sing
Upon the grass untroubling.

I told them, &quot;This is what I wish.&quot;	I went and shouted in his ear.

&quot;We cannot do it, sir, because...&quot;	He said &quot;I&apos;ll go and wake them if...&quot;

But someone came to me and said		But when I found the door was locked

I met someone who looks at lot like you,
She does the things you do, but she is an IBM.
She&apos;s only programmed to be very nice,
But she&apos;s as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,
She tells me that she likes me very much,
But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear.
...
I realize that it must seem so strange,
That time has rearranged, but time has the final word,
She knows I think of you, she reads my mind,
She tries to be unkind, she knows nothing of our world.

But seven people gave me hell		For ignoring mail I&apos;d never gotten;
And said I ought to learn to spell;	An angry message asked me, Please
					Don&apos;t send such drivel overseas;
A lawyer sent me private mail
And swore he&apos;d slap my ass in jail --	One netter thought it was a hoax:
I&apos;d mentioned Un*x in my gem		&quot;Hereafter, post to net dot jokes!&quot;;
And failed to add the T and M;		Another called my grammar vile
					And criticized my writing style.

In hopes the topic will be mine;

They exchanged jokes and poems, and clever new hacks,

He sent her a picture of his brother Sam,
She sent one from some past high school day,
And it might have gone on for the rest of their lives,
If they hadn&apos;t met in L.A.
&quot;Your beard is an armpit,&quot; she said in disgust.
He answered, &quot;Your armpit&apos;s a beard!&quot;
And they chorused: &quot;I think I could stand all the rest
If you were not so totally weird!&quot;
If she had not said what he wanted to hear,
And he had not done just the same,

And would not have had fun with the game.

its users will be content.
They enjoy hacking their code

There may be an arsenal of cracks and malware,
but nobody ever uses them.
People enjoy reading their mail,
take pleasure in being with their newsgroups,
spend weekends working at their terminals,

Here&apos;s an easy game to play.
Here&apos;s an easy thing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, 
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, 
And your data is corrupted &apos;cause the index doesn&apos;t hash, 
then your situation&apos;s hopeless, and your system&apos;s gonna crash!

You can&apos;t say this?  What a shame, sir!
We&apos;ll find you another game, sir.

If the label on the cable on the table at your house,
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, 
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That&apos;s repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
&apos;Cause as sure as I&apos;m a poet, the sucker&apos;s gonna hang!

When the copy of your floppy&apos;s getting sloppy on the disk, 
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc, 
Then you have to flash your memory and you&apos;ll want to ram your rom.
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!

And I&apos;ve got to say that I just don&apos;t get it,

I didn&apos;t get one			Yet it hurt me all year

Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Saying tell me great leader, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Saying death to all those who would whimper and cry.
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky,
Saying the sun is not yellow, it&apos;s chicken.

		<string>Just a song before I go,		Going through security
To whom it may concern,			I held her for so long.
Traveling twice the speed of sound	She finally looked at me in love,
It&apos;s easy to get burned.		And she was gone.
When the shows were over		Just a song before I go,
We had to get back home,		A lesson to be learned.
And when we opened up the door		Traveling twice the speed of sound
I had to be alone.			It&apos;s easy to get burned.
She helped me with my suitcase,
She stands before my eyes,
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies.
		-- Crosby, Stills, Nash, &quot;Just a Song Before I Go&quot;

		<string>Just machines to make big decisions,
Programmed by men for compassion and vision,

What a glorious time to be free.

		<string>`Just the place for a Snark!&apos; the Bellman cried,
	As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
	By a finger entwined in his hair.

&apos;Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it twice:
	That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it thrice:
	What I tell you three times is true.&apos;

		<string>Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone,
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you,
I went out this morning and I wrote down this song,
Just can&apos;t remember who to send it to...

Oh, I&apos;ve seen fire and I&apos;ve seen rain,
I&apos;ve seen sunny days that I thought would never end,
I&apos;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,
But I always thought that I&apos;d see you again.
Thought I&apos;d see you one more time again.

		<string>Ladies and Gentlemen, Hobos and Tramps,
Cross-eyed mosquitos and bowlegged ants,
I come before you to stand behind you
To tell you of something I know nothing about.
Next Thursday (which is good Friday),
There will be a convention held in the
Women&apos;s Club which is strictly for Men.
Admission is free, pay at the door,
Pull up a chair, and sit on the floor.
It was a summer&apos;s day in winter,
And the snow was raining fast,
As a barefoot boy with shoes on,
Stood sitting in the grass.
Oh, that bright day in the dead of night,
Two dead men got up to fight.
Three blind men to see fair play,
Forty mutes to yell &quot;Hooray&quot;!
Back to back, they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot each other.
A deaf policeman heard the noise,
Came and arrested those two dead boys.
</string>
		<string>Ladles and Jellyspoons!
I come before you to stand behind you,
To tell you something I know nothing about.
Since next Thursday will be Good Friday,
There will be a fathers&apos; meeting, for mothers only.
Wear your best clothes, if you don&apos;t have any,
And please stay at home if you can possibly be there.
Admission is free, please pay at the door.
Have a seat on me: please sit on the floor.
No matter where you manage to sit,
The man in the balcony will certainly spit.
We thank you for your unkind attention,
And would now like to present our next act:
&quot;The Four Corners of the Round Table.&quot;
</string>
		<string>Lady, lady, should you meet
One whose ways are all discreet,
One who murmurs that his wife
Is the lodestar of his life,
One who keeps assuring you
That he never was untrue,
Never loved another one...
Lady, lady, better run!
		-- Dorothy Parker, &quot;Social Note&quot;

		<string>Ladybug, ladybug,

		<string>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth&apos;s unknown, although his height be taken.
Love&apos;s not Time&apos;s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle&apos;s compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
</string>
		<string>Let us go then you and I
while the night is laid out against the sky
like a smear of mustard on an old pork pie.

&quot;Nice poem Tom.  I have ideas for changes though, why not come over?&quot;

		<string>Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument

Oh, do not ask, &quot;What is it?&quot;

		<string>Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has bought us.
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
		-- James Weldon Johnson

		<string>Like corn in a field I cut you down,
I threw the last punch way too hard,
After years of going steady, well, I thought it was time,
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards.
And I can&apos;t take you dancing out on the weekend,
I figured we&apos;d painted too much of this town,
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon,
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found,
I knew then I had lost what should have been found.
	And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
	I&apos;m as low as a paid assassin is
	You know I&apos;m cold as a hired sword.
	I&apos;m so ashamed we can&apos;t patch it up,
	You know I can&apos;t think straight no more
	You make me feel like a bullet, honey,
		a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford.

</string>
		<string>Love, which is quickly kindled in a gentle heart,
	seized this one for the fair form
	that was taken from me-and the way of it afficts me still.
Love, which absolves no loved one from loving,
	seized me so strongly with delight in him,
	that, as you see, it does not leave me even now.
Love brought us to one death.

Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Leaves, like the things of man,

Care for, can you?
Ah! as the heart grows older
It will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie
And yet you will weep and know why.
Now no matter, child, the name
Sorrow&apos;s springs are the same:
It is the blight man was born for,
It is Margaret you mourn for.

Now there are two sides to this great big world,

If you can take care of business in the sunshine, baby,

Yea, tho I walk through the valley of surprise quizzes,

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,
And he went down, but to my surprise,
Come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
So I busted a chair right across his teeth,
And we crashed through the walls and into the streets,
Kickin&apos; and a-gougin&apos; in the mud and the blood and beer.
Now I tell you, I&apos;ve fought tougher men,
But I really can&apos;t remember when:
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
But I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
And he went for his gun, but I pulled mine first,
And he sat there lookin&apos; at me, and I saw him smile.
He said: &quot;Son, this world is rough,
And if a man&apos;s gonna make it he&apos;s gotta be tough,
And I knew I wouldn&apos;t be there to help you along.
So I give you that name and I said goodbye,

On the Rue des Ecoles
lived an old man
with a blind dog
Every evening I would see him
guiding the dog along
the sidewalk, keeping
a firm grip on the leash
so that the dog wouldn&apos;t
run into a passerby
Sometimes the dog would stop
and look up at the sky
Once the old man
noticed me watching the dog
and he said, &quot;Oh, yes,
this one knows
when the moon is out,

And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.

And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.

But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, &quot;Enough!&quot;

What&apos;s one little bug?&quot;

But he was determined,			Then change two, then three more,

He dug out the flow chart		And strangers would comment,
Deserted, alone.			&quot;Is that guy still here?&quot;

Night passed into morning.		He died at the console
The room was cluttered			Of hunger and thirst
With core dumps, source listings.	Next day he was buried
&quot;I&apos;m close,&quot; he muttered.		Face down, nine edge first.

Chain smoking, cold coffee,		And his wife through her tears
Logic, deduction.			Accepted his fate.

Of sun, star, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,

		<string>Now of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It leaves me only fifty more.

Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

		<string>Now that day wearies me,
My yearning desire
Will receive more kindly,
Like a tired child, the starry night.

Hands, leave off your deeds,
Mind, forget all thoughts;
All of my forces
Yearn only to sink into sleep.

And my soul, unguarded,
Would soar on widespread wings,
To live in night&apos;s magical sphere
More profoundly, more variously.

		<string>Now&apos;s the time to have some big ideas
Now&apos;s the time to make some firm decisions
We saw the Buddha in a bar down south
Talking politics and nuclear fission
We see him and he&apos;s all washed up --
Moving on into the body of a beetle
Getting ready for a long long crawl
He  ain&apos;t nothing -- he ain&apos;t nothing at all...

Death and Money make their point once more
In the shape of Philosophical assassins
Mark and Danny take the bus uptown
Deadly angels for reality and passion
Have the courage of the here and now
Don&apos;t taking nothing from the half-baked buddhas
When you think you got it paid in full
You got nothing -- you got nothing at all...
	We&apos;re on the road and we&apos;re gunning for the Buddha.
	We know his name and he mustn&apos;t get away.

I&apos;m on a committee,			We attend and amend
Which means that from morning		And contend and defend

We confer and concur,
We defer and demur,			We revise the agenda
And reiterate all of our thoughts.	With frequent addenda
					And consider a load of reports.

We compose and propose,
We suppose and oppose,			But though various notions
And the points of procedure are fun;	Are brought up as motions,
					There&apos;s terribly little gets done.

We resolve and absolve;
But we never dissolve,
Since it&apos;s out of the question for us
To bring our committee
To end like this ditty,
Which stops with a period, thus.

Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town?
And whence such fair garments such prosperi-ty?&quot;
&quot;Oh, didn&apos;t you know I&apos;d been ruined?&quot; said she.

&quot;You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks,
Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks;
And now you&apos;ve gay bracelets and bright feathers three!&quot;
&quot;Yes: That&apos;s how we dress when we&apos;re ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;At home in the barton you said `thee&apos; and `thou,&apos;
And `thik oon&apos; and `theas oon&apos; and `t&apos;other;&apos; but now
Your talking quite fits &apos;ee for compa-ny!&quot;
&quot;Some polish is gained with one&apos;s ruin,&quot; said she.

&quot;Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak
But now I&apos;m bewitched by your delicate cheek,
And your little gloves fit like as on any la-dy!&quot;
&quot;We never do work when we&apos;re ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
And you&apos;d sigh, and you&apos;d sock; but at present you seem
To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!&quot;
&quot;True.  One&apos;s pretty lively when ruined,&quot; said she.

&quot;I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!&quot;
&quot;My dear--a raw country girl, such as you be,
Cannot quite expect that.  You ain&apos;t ruined,&quot; said she.

Wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence.
Hovering there
I&apos;ve chased the shouting wind along and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air.
Up, up along delirious, burning blue
I&apos;ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,
Where never lark, or even eagle flew;
And, while with silent, lifting mind I&apos;ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

		<string>On a morning from a Bogart movie, in a country where they turned back time,
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime.
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain.
Don&apos;t bother asking for explanations, she&apos;ll just tell you that she came
In the Year of the Cat.

She doesn&apos;t give you time for questions, as she locks up your arm in hers,
And you follow &apos;till your sense of which direction completely disappears.
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stall there&apos;s a hidden door she
    leads you to.
These days, she say, I feel my life just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat.

Well, she looks at you so coolly,
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea.
She comes in incense and patchouli,
So you take her to find what&apos;s waiting inside
The Year of the Cat.

Well, morning comes and you&apos;re still with her, but the bus and the tourists
    are gone,
And you&apos;ve thrown away your choice and lost your ticket, so you have to stay on.
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain in the rhythm of the new-born day.
You know some time you&apos;re bound to leave her, but for now you&apos;re going to stay
In the Year of the Cat.

And the Klingons often go berserk.

And Nurse Chapel never gets her way.

	See Captain Kirk standing on the bridge,

Peace reigns anew o&apos;er Pine Valley,

Beware, scant days past the Ides of July.
Impatient hands wait eagerly
to grasp, to hold
scant moments of time
wrested from life in the full
glory of Canon&apos;s power;
held captive by his unblinking eye.

one each to toll the day, hour, minute

And then yank back the i-access times to get hackers off his tail,
And once as he finished reading from the secretary&apos;s spool,
He wrote a rude rejection to her boyfriend (how uncool!)
And this as delivermail did work and he ran his backfstat,
He heard an awful crackling like rat fritters in hot fat,
And hard errors brought the system down &apos;fore he could even shout!
	And the bio bug&apos;ll bring yours down too, ef you don&apos;t watch out!
And once they was a little flake who&apos;d prowl through the uulog,
And when he went to his blit that night to play at being god,
The ops all heard him holler, and they to the console dashed,
But when they did a ps -ut they found the system crashed!
Oh, the wizards adb&apos;d the dumps and did the system trace,
And worked on the file system &apos;til the disk head was hot paste,
But all they ever found was this:  &quot;panic: never doubt&quot;,
	And the bio bug&apos;ll crash your box too, ef you don&apos;t watch out!
When the day is done and the moon comes out,
And you hear the printer whining and the rk&apos;s seems to count,
When the other desks are empty and their terminals glassy grey,
And the load is only 1.6 and you wonder if it&apos;ll stay,
You must mind the file protections and not snoop around,
	Or the bio bug&apos;ll getcha and bring the system down!

While you pondered sentient and crystalline,

Skulking at my chamber door.

		<string>One bright Sunday morning, in the shadows of the steeple,
By the Relief Office, I seen my people;
As they stood there hungry, I stood there whistling,
This land was made for you and me.

Nobody living can ever stop me,
As I go walking that freedom highway;
Nobody living can ever make me turn back,
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking, I saw a sign there,
And on the sign it said: &quot;No Trespassing.&quot;
But on the other side, it didn&apos;t say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.

Her name was Ann, and I&apos;ll be damned if I recall her face,

Carefree Highway, let me slip away on you,
Carefree Highway, you seen better days,
The morning after blues, from my head down to my shoes,
Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away, on you...

Turning back the pages to the times I love best,
I wonder if she&apos;ll ever do the same,
Now the thing that I call livin&apos; is just bein&apos; satisfied,
With knowing I got noone left to blame.
Carefree Highway, I got to see you, my old flame...

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep,
I wonder if the years have closed her mind,

		<string>Reach into the thoughts of friends,
And find they do not know your name.
Squeeze the teddy bear too tight,
And watch the feathers burst the seams.
Touch the stained glass with your cheek,
And feel its chill upon your blood.
Hold a candle to the night,
And see the darkness bend the flame.
Tear the mask of peace from God,
And hear the roar of souls in hell.
Pluck a rose in name of love,
And watch the petals curl and wilt.
Lean upon the western wind,
And know you are alone.

		<string>Roland was a warrior, from the land of the midnight sun,
With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done.
The deal was made in Denmark, on a dark and stormy day,
So he set out for Biafra, to join the bloody fray.
Through sixty-six and seven, they fought the Congo war,
With their fingers on their triggers, knee deep in gore.
Days and nights they battled, the Bantu to their knees,
They killed to earn their living, and to help out the Congolese.
	Roland the Thompson gunner...
His comrades fought beside him, Van Owen and the rest,
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best.
So the C.I.A decided, they wanted Roland dead,
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen, blew off Roland&apos;s head.
	Roland the headless Thompson gunner...
Roland searched the continent, for the man who&apos;d done him in.
He found him in Mombasa, in a bar room drinking gin,
Roland aimed his Thompson gun, he didn&apos;t say a word,
But he blew Van Owen&apos;s body from there to Johannesburg.
The eternal Thompson gunner, still wandering through the night,
Now it&apos;s ten years later, but he stills keeps up the fight.
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine, in Berkeley,
Patty Hearst... heard the burst... of Roland&apos;s Thompson gun, and bought it.

		<string>The leaves were long, the grass was green,
The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,
And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars in shadow shimmering.
Tin&apos;uviel was dancing there
To music of a pipe unseen,
And light of stars was in her hair,
And in her raiment glimmering.

There Beren came from mountains colds,
And lost he wandered under leaves,
And where the Elven-river rolled
He walked alone and sorrowing.
He peered between the hemlock-leaves
And saw in wonder flowers of gold
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,
And her hair like shadow following.

Enchantment healed his weary feet
That over hills were doomed to roam;
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,
And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
Through woven woods in Elvenhome
She lightly fled on dancing feet,
And left him lonely still to roam
In the silent forest listening.

You like to think that you&apos;re immune to the stuff

You&apos;re addicted to love!&quot;

		<string>	The Lord and I are in a sheep-shepherd relationship, and I am in
a position of negative need.
	He prostrates me in a green-belt grazing area.
	He conducts me directionally parallel to non-torrential aqueous
liquid.
	He returns to original satisfaction levels my psychological makeup.
	He switches me on to a positive behavioral format for maximal
prestige of His identity.
	It should indeed be said that notwithstanding the fact that I make
ambulatory progress through the umbragious inter-hill mortality slot, terror
sensations will no be initiated in me, due to para-etical phenomena.
	Your pastoral walking aid and quadrupic pickup unit introduce me
into a pleasurific mood state.
	You design and produce a nutriment-bearing furniture-type structure
in the context of non-cooperative elements.
	You act out a head-related folk ritual employing vegetable extract.
	My beverage utensil experiences a volume crisis.
	It is an ongoing deductible fact that your inter-relational
empathetical and non-ventious capabilities will retain me as their
target-focus for the duration of my non-death period, and I will possess
tenant rights in the housing unit of the Lord on a permanent, open-ended
time basis.

You took me away from home,
Just to save you from being alone;
You stole my heart, and that&apos;s what really hurts.

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school,
Or steal my daddy&apos;s cue and make a living out of playing pool,
Or find myself a rock &apos;n&apos; roll band,
That needs a helping hand,
Oh, Maggie I wish I&apos;d never seen your face.

But I&apos;m as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my soul, and that&apos;s a pain I can do without.

		<string>The Poet Whose Badness Saved His Life
	The most important poet in the seventeenth century was George
Wither.  Alexander Pope called him &quot;wretched Wither&quot; and Dryden said of his
verse that &quot;if they rhymed and rattled all was well&quot;.
	In our own time, &quot;The Dictionary of National Biography&quot; notes that his
work &quot;is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.  It usually
lacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel&quot;.
	High praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically
rewarding stanza: It is taken from &quot;I loved a lass&quot; and is concerned with
the higher emotions.
		She would me &quot;Honey&quot; call,
		She&apos;d -- O she&apos;d kiss me too.
		But now alas!  She&apos;s left me
		Falero, lero, loo.
	Among other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize
was her prudent choice of footwear.
		The fives did fit her shoe.
	In 1639 the great poet&apos;s life was endangered after his capture by
the Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the
Royalist poet, heard of Wither&apos;s imminent execution, he went to the King and
begged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,
&quot;Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the
worst poet in England.&quot;

And surly Winter grimly flies.

All creatures joy in the sun&apos;s returning,
And I rejoice in my bonnie Bell.

Then in his turn come gloomy Winter,
Till smiling Spring again appear.
Thus seasons dancing, life advancing,
Old Time and Nature their changes tell;
But never ranging, still unchanging,
I adore my bonnie Bell.

		<string>The Worst American Poet
	Julia Moore, &quot;the Sweet Singer of Michigan&quot; (1847-1920) was so bad that
Mark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.
	Her verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire
of Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her pen.
	Whether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the
formula was the same:
		Have you heard of the dreadful fate
		Of Mr. P.P. Bliss and wife?
		Of their death I will relate,
		And also others lost their life
		(in the) Ashbula Bridge disaster,
		Where so many people died.
	Even if you started out reasonably healthy in one of Julia&apos;s poems,
the chances are that after a few stanzas you would be at the bottom of a
river or struck by lightning.  A critic of the day said she was &quot;worse than
a Gatling gun&quot; and in one slim volume counted 21 killed and 9 wounded.
	Incredibly, some newspapers were critical of her work, even
suggesting that the sweet singer was &quot;semi-literate&quot;.  Her reply was
forthright: &quot;The Editors that has spoken in this scandalous manner have went
beyond reason.&quot;  She added that &quot;literary work is very difficult to do&quot;.

</string>
		<string>		The Worst Lines of Verse
For a start, we can rule out James Grainger&apos;s promising line:
	&quot;Come, muse, let us sing of rats.&quot;
Grainger (1721-67) did not have the courage of his convictions and deleted
these words on discovering that his listeners dissolved into spontaneous
laughter the instant they were read out.
	No such reluctance afflicted Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) who was
inspired by the subject of war.
	&quot;Flash! flash! bang! bang! and we blazed away,
	And the grey roof reddened and rang;
	Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay
	The tip of my ear.  Flash! bang!&quot;
By contrast, Cheshire cheese provoked John Armstrong (1709-79):
	&quot;... that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste of solid milk...&quot;
While John Bidlake was guided by a compassion for vegetables:
	&quot;The sluggard carrot sleeps his day in bed,
	The crippled pea alone that cannot stand.&quot;
George Crabbe (1754-1832) wrote:
	&quot;And I was ask&apos;d and authorized to go
	To seek the firm of Clutterbuck and Co.&quot;
William Balmford explored the possibilities of religious verse:
	&quot;So &apos;tis with Christians, Nature being weak
	While in this world, are liable to leak.&quot;
And William Wordsworth showed that he could do it if he really tried when
describing a pond:
	&quot;I&apos;ve measured it from side to side;
	Tis three feet long and two feet wide.&quot;

		<string>There are places I&apos;ll remember
All my life though some have changed.
Some forever not for better 
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I&apos;ve loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers,
There is no one compared with you,
All these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I&apos;ll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I&apos;ll often stop and think about them
In my life I&apos;ll love you more.

		<string>There once was a Sailor who looked through a glass

A sittin&apos; out there on the rocks.&quot;
The crew came a running, all grabbing their... glasses.
And crowded four deep to the rail.
All eager to share in this fine piece of... news.
...
&quot;Throw out a line and we&apos;ll lasso her... flippers.
And soon we will certainly find
If mermaids are better before or be... brave

And cursing with spleen.

		<string>There&apos;s a lesson that I need to remember
When everything is falling apart

		<string>There&apos;s amnesia in a hangknot,
And comfort in the ax,
But the simple way of poison will make your nerves relax.
	There&apos;s surcease in a gunshot,
	And sleep that comes from racks,
	But a handy draft of poison avoids the harshest tax.
You find rest on the hot squat,
Or gas can give you pax,
But the closest corner chemist has peace in packaged stacks.
	There&apos;s refuge in the church lot
	When you tire of facing facts,
	And the smoothest route is poison prescribed by kindly quacks.
Chorus:	With an *ugh!* and a groan, and a kick of the heels,
	Death comes quiet, or it comes with squeals --
	But the pleasantest place to find your end
	Is a cup of cheer from the hand of a friend.

For art is a form of catharsis,
	And love is a permanent flop,
And work is the province of cattle,
	And rest&apos;s for a clam in a shell,
So I&apos;m thinking of throwing the battle --
	Would you kindly direct me to hell?

		<string>They told me you had proven it		When they discovered our results

And after we were done, to them		A secret, kept from all the rest

We quickly turned it into code

To bring up a virgin machine,		To debug that code,
To pop out of endless recursion,	No matter how hopeless,
To grok what appears on the screen,	No matter the load,
					To write those routines
To right the unrightable bug,		Without question or pause,
To endlessly twiddle and thrash,	To be willing to hack FORTRAN IV
To mount the unmountable magtape,	For a heavenly cause.
To stop the unstoppable crash!		And I know if I&apos;ll only be true
					To this glorious quest,
And the queue will be better for this,	That my code will run CUSPy and calm,
That one man, scorned and		When it&apos;s put to the test.

Still strove with his last allocation

		<string>To write a sonnet you must ruthlessly
strip down your words to naked, willing flesh.
Then bind them to a metaphor or three,
and take by force a satisfying mesh.
Arrange them to your will, each foot in place.
You are the master here, and they the slaves.
Now whip them to maintain a constant pace
and rhythm as they stand in even staves.
A word that strikes no pleasure?  Cast it out!
What use are words that drive not to the heart?
A lazy phrase? Discard it, shrug off doubt,
and choose more docile words to take its part.
A well-trained sonnet lives to entertain,
by making love directly to the brain.

		<string>Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,
And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;
For many a year he had gnawed it near,
For meat was hard to come by.
	Done by!  Gum by!
In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,
And meat was hard to come by.

Up came Tom with his big boots on.
Said he to Troll: &quot;Pray, what is youn?
For it looks like the shin o&apos; my nuncle Tim,
As should be a-lyin in graveyard.
	Caveyard!  Paveyard!
This many a year has Tim been gone,
And I thought he were lyin&apos; in graveyard.&quot;

&quot;My lad,&quot; said Troll, &quot;this bone I stole.
But what be bones that lie in a hole?
Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o&apos; lead,
Afore I found his shinbone.
	Tinbone!  Thinbone!
He can spare a share for a poor old troll
For he don&apos;t need his shinbone.&quot;

Said Tom: &quot;I don&apos;t see why the likes o&apos; thee
Without axin&apos; leave should go makin&apos; free
With the shank or the shin o&apos; my father&apos;s kin;
So hand the old bone over!
	Rover!  Trover!
Though dead he be, it belongs to he;
So hand the old bnone over!&quot;

Not a streetcar was in sight,		Except one a tiny tot,
So I stepped into a cigar store		Who had a home across the way
To ask them for a light.		Above a vacant lot.

The man	behind the counter		As I gazed through the oaken door
Was a woman, old and gray,		A whale went drifting by,
Who used to peddle doughnuts		Its six legs hanging in the air,
On the road to Mandalay.		So I kissed her goodbye.

She said &quot;Good morning, stranger&quot;,	This story has a morale
Her eyes were dry with tears,		As you can plainly see,
As she put her head between her feet	Don&apos;t mix your gin with whiskey
And stood that way for years.		On the deep and dark blue sea.

The programmers were wrung out too mindless to care,
	Knowing chances of cutover hadn&apos;t a prayer.

	While visions of inquiries danced in their heads.
When out in the lobby there arose such a clatter,
	I sprang from my tube to see what was the matter.
And what to my wondering eyes should appear,
	But a Super Programmer, oblivious to fear.
More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
	And he whistled and shouted and called them by name;
On Update!  On Add!  On Inquiry!  On Delete!
	On Batch Jobs!  On Closing!  On Functions Complete!
His eyes were glazed over, his fingers were lean,
	From Weekends and nights in front of a screen.

And in thy horrid ribs dare steep
In the well of sanguine woe?

					Towards the Moon or to the Sun,
Home is behind, the world ahead,	  Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,
And there are many paths to tread	  Let them go!  Let them go!
Through shadows to the edge of night,	  Sand and stone and pool and dell,
Until the stars are all alight.		  Fare you well!  Fare you well!
Then world behind and home ahead,
We&apos;ll wander back to home and bed.

The headline screamed that I was still alive,
I couldn&apos;t understand it, I thought I died last night.

In a little cantina that the boys had found,
I was desperate to dance, just to dig the local sounds.

She looked so good that I had to meet her,
I was ready to approach her with my English charm,
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm,
And he said, grow some funk of your own, amigo,
Grow some funk of your own.

But there might be a death in Mexico tonite.

And grow some funk, grow your funk at home.

I&apos;d just hit town and my throat was dry,
Thought I&apos;d stop and have myself a brew,
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
Sitting at a table, dealing stud,
Sat that dirty (bleep) that named me Sue.

And as you surf in the hot tub with sourdough roll
Please ponder the passing of your sole Monopole.
Your Olympics were fun, you should bring them all back
For transsexual tennis or Anamalon Track,
But Hollywood movies remain sinfully crude
Whether seen on the telly or Remotely Viewed.

					When I think about myself.
My folks can make me split my side,
I laughed so hard I nearly died,

I laugh until I start to crying,

		<string>When the Guru administers, the users

Next best is a sysop who is loved.

		<string>When users see one GUI as beautiful,
other user interfaces become ugly.
When users see some programs as winners,
other programs become lossage.

Pointers and NULLs reference each other.
High level and assembler depend on each other.
Double and float cast to each other.
High-endian and low-endian define each other.
While and until follow each other.

Therefore the Guru 
programs without doing anything
and teaches without saying anything.
Warnings arise and he lets them come;
processes are swapped and he lets them go.
He has but doesn&apos;t possess,
acts but doesn&apos;t expect.
When his work is done, he deletes it.
That is why it lasts forever.

And the world makes you king for a day,

	Whose judgement upon you must pass;
	The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
	Is the one staring back from the glass.
Some people may think you a straight-shootin&apos; chum
And call you a wonderful guy,
But the man in the glass says you&apos;re only a bum
If you can&apos;t look him straight in the eye.
	He&apos;s the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,
	For he&apos;s with you clear up to the end,
	And you&apos;ve passed your most dangerous, difficult test

And get pats on the back as you pass,
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears

		<string>Whenever Richard Cory went downtown,
	We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
	Clean-favored, and imperially slim.
And he was always quietly arrayed,
	And he was always human when he talked;
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
	&quot;Good morning,&quot; and he glittered when he walked.
And he was rich -- yes, richer than a king --
	And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
	To make us wish that we were in his place.
So on we worked, and waited for the light,
	And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
	Went home and put a bullet through his head.

Professor Doberman:
	While the preceding poem is unarguably a change from the guarded 
pessimism of &quot;The Hound of Heaven,&quot; it cannot be regarded as an unqualified 
improvement.  Obscurity is of value only when it tends to clarify the poetic
experience.  As much as one is compelled to admire the poem&apos;s technique, one 
must question whether its byplay of complex literary allusions does not in 
fact distract from the unity of the whole.  In the final analysis, one 
receives the distinct impression that the poem&apos;s length could safely have 
been reduced by a factor of eight or ten without sacrificing any of its
meaning.  It is to be hoped that further publication of this poem can be 
suspended pending a thorough investigation of its potential subversive 
implications.

		<string>Yesterday upon the stair
I met a man who wasn&apos;t there.
He wasn&apos;t there again today --
I think he&apos;s from the CIA.
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old, Father William,&quot; the young man said,
	&quot;All your papers these days look the same;
Those William&apos;s would be better unread --
	Do these facts never fill you with shame?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; Father William replied to his son,
	&quot;I wrote wonderful papers galore;
But the great reputation I found that I&apos;d won,
	Made it pointless to think any more.&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old, father William,&quot; the young man said,
	&quot;And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head --
	Do you think, at your age, it is right?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; father William replied to his son,
	&quot;I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I&apos;m perfectly sure I have none,
	Why, I do it again and again.&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,
	And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door --
	Pray what is the reason of that?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
	&quot;I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box --
	Allow me to sell you a couple?&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and I&apos;m told by my peers
	That your lectures bore people to death.
Yet you talk at one hundred conventions per year --
	Don&apos;t you think that you should save your breath?&quot;

&quot;I have answered three questions and that is enough,&quot;
	Said his father, &quot;Don&apos;t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
	Be off, or I&apos;ll kick you downstairs!&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your jaws are too weak
	For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak --
	Pray, how did you manage to do it?&quot;

&quot;In my youth,&quot; said his father, &quot;I took to the law,
	And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
	Has lasted the rest of my life.&quot;

&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;one would hardly suppose
	That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose --
	What made you so awfully clever?&quot;

&quot;I have answered three questions, and that is enough,&quot;
	Said his father.  &quot;Don&apos;t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
	Be off, or I&apos;ll kick you down stairs!&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your programs don&apos;t run,
	And there isn&apos;t one language you like;
Yet of useful suggestions for help you have none --
	Have you thought about taking a hike?&quot;

&quot;Since I never write programs,&quot; his father replied,
	&quot;Every language looks equally bad;
Yet the people keep paying to read all my books
	And don&apos;t realize that they&apos;ve been had.&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;You are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,
	And make errors few people could bear;
You complain about everyone&apos;s English but yours --
	Do you really think this is quite fair?&quot;

&quot;I make lots of mistakes,&quot; Father William declared,
	&quot;But my stature these days is so great
That no critic can hurt me -- I&apos;ve got them all scared,
	And to stop me it&apos;s now far too late.&quot;

		<string>A large spider in an old house built a beautiful web in which to catch flies.
Every time a fly landed on the web and was entangled in it the spider devoured

quiet place in which to rest.  One day a fairly intelligent fly buzzed around
above the web so long without lighting that the spider appeared and said,
&quot;Come on down.&quot;  But the fly was too clever for him and said, &quot;I never light
where I don&apos;t see other flies and I don&apos;t see any other flies in your house.&quot;
So he flew away until he came to a place where there were a great many other
flies.  He was about to settle down among them when a bee buzzed up and said,
&quot;Hold it, stupid, that&apos;s flypaper.  All those flies are trapped.&quot;  &quot;Don&apos;t be
silly,&quot; said the fly, &quot;they&apos;re dancing.&quot;  So he settled down and became stuck
to the flypaper with all the other flies.

		<string>	A MODERN FABLE

Aesop&apos;s fables and other traditional children&apos;s stories involve allegory
far too subtle for the youth of today.  Children need an updated message
with contemporary circumstance and plot line, and short enough to suit
today&apos;s minute attention span.

	The Troubled Aardvark

Once upon a time, there was an aardvark whose only pleasure in life was
driving from his suburban bungalow to his job at a large brokerage house
in his brand new 4x4.  He hated his manipulative boss, his conniving and
unethical co-workers, his greedy wife, and his snivelling, spoiled
children.  One day, the aardvark reflected on the meaning of his life and
his career and on the unchecked, catastrophic decline of his nation, its
pathetic excuse for leadership, and the complete ineffectiveness of any
personal effort he could make to change the status quo.  Overcome by a
wave of utter depression and self-doubt, he decided to take the only
course of action that would bring him greater comfort and happiness: he
drove to the mall and bought imported consumer electronics goods.

MORAL OF THE STORY:  Invest in foreign consumer electronics manufacturers.

		<string>Bozo is the Brotherhood of Zips and Others.  Bozos are people who band
together for fun and profit.  They have no jobs.  Anybody who goes on a
tour is a Bozo. Why does a Bozo cross the street?  Because there&apos;s a Bozo
on the other side. It comes from the phrase vos otros, meaning others.
They&apos;re the huge, fat, middle waist.  The archetype is an Irish drunk
clown with red hair and nose, and pale skin.  Fields, William Bendix.
Everybody tends to drift toward Bozoness.  It has Oz in it.  They mean
well.  They&apos;re straight-looking except they&apos;ve got inflatable shoes.  They
like their comforts.  The Bozos have learned to enjoy their free time,
which is all the time.

Basically, a tool is an object that enables you to take advantage of the

yourself.  Today, people tend to take tools for granted.  If you&apos;re ever

High Priest:	Skip a bit, brother.
Bro. Maynard:	And then the Lord spake, saying: &quot;First, shalt thou take

	*Three* shall be the number of the counting, and the number of the
	counting shall be three.  *Four* shalt thou not count, and neither
	count thou two, excepting that thou then goest on to three.  Five is

they seem.  For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed
that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so
much -- the wheel, New York, wars and so on -- whilst all the dolphins
had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But
conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more
intelligent than man -- for precisely the same reasons.

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending
destruction of the of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to
alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were
misinterpreted ...

		<string>Like you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questions related to man&apos;s
place in the Scheme of Things.  Here are just a few:

	Q -- Is there life after death?
	A -- Definitely.  I speak from personal experience here.  On New
Year&apos;s Eve, 1970, I drank a full pitcher of a drink called &quot;Black Russian&quot;,
then crawled out on the lawn and died within a matter of minutes, which was
fine with me because I had come to realize that if I had lived I would have
spent the rest of my life in the grip of the most excruciatingly painful
headache.  Thanks to the miracle of modern orange juice, I was brought back
to life several days later, but in the interim I was definitely dead.  I
guess my main impression of the afterlife is that it isn&apos;t so bad as long
as you keep the television turned down and don&apos;t try to eat any solid foods.

the old shaman said carefully, &quot;You didn&apos;t just see two men go through

		<string>	My friends, I am here to tell you of the wonderous continent known as
Africa.  Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.
We were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in
Africa.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at
6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by
6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That
was the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Moose
and Knights of Pithiests.
	The elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their
annual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,
which they leave immediately when they discover it&apos;s full of water.  They
weren&apos;t looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.
	One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my
pajamas, I don&apos;t know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That&apos;s a tough
word to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were
imbedded so firmly we couldn&apos;t get them out.  But in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,
but that is totally irrelephant to what I was saying.
	We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren&apos;t developed.
So we&apos;re going back in a few years...

		<string>Thank goodness modern convenience is a thing of the remote future.
		-- Pogo, by Walt Kelly
</string>
		<string>The basic idea behind malls is that they are more convenient than cities.
Cities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowded and difficult to
park in.  Malls, on the other hand, have parking lots, which are also
dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but -- here is the big
difference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO RULES.  You&apos;re allowed to
do anything.  You can drive as fast as you want in any direction you want.
I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car was struck by a pickup
truck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that said &quot;Charlie&quot;
on his forearm, who got out and explained to me, in great detail, why the
accident was my fault, his reasoning being that he was violent and muscular,
whereas I was neither.  This kind of reasoning is legally valid in mall
parking lots.

the subject of towels.
	Most importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For
some reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel
with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a
toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,
the non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or
a dozen other items that he may have &quot;lost&quot;.  After all, any man who can
hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds,
win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned with.

	&quot;Sure.  I honk the horn, slam the door, turn on all the lights,
stomp up to the bedroom and give my wife a big kiss.  `Hi, Alice,&apos; I say.
`How about a little smooch for your old man?&apos;&quot;

	&quot;Excuse me, sir, but I&apos;ve been seeing you for hours now,
carrying on at this grave.  You must have been very close to the deceased.&quot;
	&quot;No, I never met him.  Oh why....eeeee did you dieeeeee,

		<string>A man was talking to his best friend about his married life.  &quot;You know,&quot; he
says, &quot;I really trust my wife, and I think she has always been faithful to
me, but there&apos;s *always* that doubt.  There&apos;s *always* that little doubt.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean,&quot; his friend replies.
	&quot;Well, buddy, I&apos;ve got to leave on a business trip this weekend,
and I wonder... well... would you watch my house while I&apos;m gone?  I trust
her, it&apos;s just that there&apos;s *always* that doubt.&quot;
	The friend agreed to help out and two weeks later gave his report.
	&quot;I&apos;ve got some bad news for you,&quot; says the friend.  &quot;The evening
after you left I saw a strange car pull up in front of your house.  A man
got out of the car and went in the house and had dinner with your wife.
After dinner they went upstairs and I saw your wife kissing him.  Then, he
took off his shirt and she took off her blouse.  And then the light went
out.&quot;
	&quot;*Then* what happened?&quot; said the husband, his eyes opening wide.
	&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied the friend, &quot;it was too dark to see.&quot;
	&quot;Damn!&quot; roared the husband.  &quot;You see what I mean?  There&apos;s *always*
that doubt!&quot;

		<string>A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist
thought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the
problem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male
aggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy
away from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman&apos;s
participation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility
will appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to
men.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to
idealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by
the system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own
submission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to
is to substitute moral outrage for analysis.

		<string>A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing the
consequences and implications of a married man&apos;s having a mistress.  The
sociologist&apos;s opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivable
for a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowly
and lustful pursuits.
	The psychologist&apos;s opinion was that although morally reprehensible,
if a man MUST have a mistress to achieve his full potential as a human being,
then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a mistress, as long as he
is considerate enough to keep this secret from his wife.
	The engineer then interjected: &quot;I also believe that, if necessary,
a married man is entitled to a mistress.  However, I do not see why the
affair should be concealed from the wife.  On the contrary, if the affair
is out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that he
is going to see his mistress, tell his mistress that he is going to be with
his wife, then go to his office and get some work done!&quot;

		<string>A young man enters the New York branch of Tiffany&apos;s on a Friday evening and

I could never spend it all.  I&apos;d really like for you to have it.&quot;

can&apos;t release the necklace immediately, would Monday be all right?&quot;

		<string>American culture is based on the automobile, and any young man of promise

any young woman of aspiration should expect to spend most of her vacations

to drive but she will certainly be expected to read the road map while her
husband drives, and if she can&apos;t, or if she&apos;s abnormally slow in giving him
help, she&apos;s bound to cause trouble.  Therefore, you&apos;d think that colleges
which train the bright young women who&apos;re going to marry the bright young

		<string>Another greeting card category consists of those persons who send out
photographs of their families every year.  In the same mail that brought the
greetings from Marcia and Philip, my friend found such a conversation piece.
&quot;My God, Lida is enormous!&quot; she exclaimed.  I don&apos;t know why women want to
record each year, for two or three hundred people to see, the ravages wrought
upon them, their mates, and their progeny by the artillery of time, but
between five and seven per cent of Christmas cards, at a rough estimate, are
family groups, and even the most charitable recipient studies them for little
signs of dissolution or derangement.  Nothing cheers a woman more, I am afraid,
than the proof that another woman is letting herself go, or has lost control
of her figure, or is clearly driving her husband crazy, or is obviously
drinking more than is good for her, or still doesn&apos;t know what to wear.
Middle-aged husbands in such photographs are often described as looking
&quot;young enough to be her son,&quot; but they don&apos;t always escape so easily, and a
couple opening envelopes in the season of mercy and good will sometimes handle
a male friend or acquaintance rather sharply.  &quot;Good Lord!&quot; the wife will say.

bed.  Guys were after me like you can&apos;t believe.  That&apos;s when I started
chewing tobacco -- because no matter how bad anybody treats you, it&apos;s not
as bad as this.  This is the worst chew in the world.  After this,
everything else is peaches and cream.&quot;  The writers elected Gentleman Jim,
the Sparrow&apos;s P.R. guy, to bite off a chunk and tell them how it tasted,
and as he sat and chewed it tears ran down his old sunburnt cheeks and he

		<string>Dear Miss Manners:
I carry a big black umbrella, even if there&apos;s just a thirty percent chance of
rain.  May I ask a young lady who is a stranger to me to share its protection?
This morning, I was waiting for a bus in comparative comfort, my umbrella
protecting me from the downpour, and noticed an attractive young woman getting
soaked.  I have often seen her at my bus stop, although we have never spoken,
and I don&apos;t even know her name.  Could I have asked her to get under my
umbrella without seeming insulting?

Gentle Reader:
Certainly.  Consideration for those less fortunate than you is always proper,
although it would be more convincing if you stopped babbling about how
attractive she is.  In order not to give Good Samaritanism a bad name, Miss

discourse, you may step back two paces, bring out your handkerchief, and
go through the motions of wiping your nose, while trailing the cloth along
your face to pick up whatever needs mopping along the route.  If, however,
the substance was acquired as a result of enthusiasm of a more intimate

refers to it as &quot;that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regular
basis&quot;.
	When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to
her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled &quot;All Men Are Idiots&quot;.  Then
she will get on with her life.
	A man has a little more trouble letting go.  Six months after the
breakup, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, &quot;I just
wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I&apos;ll never forgive you, and I
hate you, and you&apos;re a total floozy.  But I want you to know that there&apos;s
always a chance for us&quot;.  This is known as the &quot;I Hate You / I Love You&quot;
drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once.  There are
community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas,
these classes rarely prove effective.

Shoes:
	 The average man has 4 pairs of footwear: running shoes, dress shoes,
boots, and slippers.  The average woman has shoes 4 layers thick on the floor
of her closet.  Most of them hurt her feet.
 
Making friends:
	 A woman will meet another woman with common interests, do a few things
together, and say something like, &quot;I hope we can be good friends.&quot;
	A man will meet another man with common interests, do a few things
together, and say nothing.  After years of interacting with this other man,
sharing hopes and fears that he wouldn&apos;t confide in his priest or
psychiatrist, he&apos;ll finally let down his guard in a fit of drunken
sentimentality and say something like, &quot;You know, for someone who&apos;s such a
jerk, I guess you&apos;re OK.&quot;

Desserts:
	A woman will generally admire an ornate dessert for the artistic
work it is, praising its creator and waiting a suitable interval before
she reluctantly takes a small sliver off one edge.  A man will start by
grabbing the cherry in the center.

Car repair:
	The average man thinks his Y chromosome contains complete repair
manuals for every car made since World War II.  He will work on a problem
himself until it either goes away or turns into something that &quot;can&apos;t be
fixed without special tools&quot;.
	The average woman thinks &quot;that funny thump-thump noise&quot; is an
accurate description of an automotive problem.  She will, however, have the
car serviced at the proper intervals and thereby incur fewer problems than
the average man.
</string>
		<string>FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#4

Clothes:
	Men don&apos;t discard clothes.  The average man still has the gym shirt
he wore in high school.  He thinks a jacket is &quot;just getting broken in&quot; about
the time it develops holes in the elbows.  A man will let new shirts sit on
the shelf in their original packaging for a couple of years before putting
them to use, hoping they&apos;ll become more comfortable with age.
	Women think clothes are radioactive, with a half-life of one year.
They exercise precautions to avoid contamination by last year&apos;s fashions.
</string>
		<string>FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#5

Trust:
	The average woman would really like to be told if her mate is fooling
around behind her back.  This same woman wouldn&apos;t tell her best friend if
she knew the best friends&apos; mate was having an affair.  She&apos;ll tell all her
OTHER friends, however.  The average man won&apos;t say anything if he knows that
one of his friend&apos;s mates is fooling around, and he&apos;d rather not know if
his mate is having an affair either, out of fear that it might be with one
of his friends.  He will tell all his friends about his own affairs, though,
so they can be ready if he needs an alibi.

Driving:
	A typical man thinks he&apos;s Mario Andretti as soon as he slips behind
the wheel of his car.  The fact that it&apos;s an 8-year-old Honda doesn&apos;t keep
him from trying to out-accelerate the guy in the Porsche who&apos;s attempting
to cut him off; freeway on-ramps are exciting challenges to see who has The
Right Stuff on the morning commute.  Does he or doesn&apos;t he?  Only his body
shop knows for sure.  Insurance companies understand this behavior, and
price their policies accordingly.
	A woman will slow down to let a car merge in front of her, and get
rear-ended by another woman who was busy adding the finishing touches to
her makeup.

Bathrooms:
	A man has six items in his bathroom -- a toothbrush, toothpaste,
shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn.
The average number of items in the typical woman&apos;s bathroom is 437.  A man
would not be able to identify most of these items.

Groceries:
	A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store
and buys these things.  A man waits &apos;til the only items left in his fridge
are half a lime and a Blue Ribbon.  Then he goes grocery shopping.  He buys
everything that looks good.  By the time a man reaches the checkout counter,
his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett&apos;s car on Beverly Hillbillies.
Of course, this will not stop him from entering the 10-items-or-less lane.

Going Out:
	When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go
out.  When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she WILL be ready
to go out, as soon as she finds her earring, finishes putting on her makeup,
checks on the kids, makes a phone call to her best friend...

Cats:
	Women love cats.  Men say they love cats, but when women aren&apos;t
looking, men kick cats.

Offspring:
	Ah, children.  A woman knows all about her children.  She knows
about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends
and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams.  Men are vaguely
aware of some short people living in the house.

Laundry:
	Women do laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every article
of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight
years ago, before he will do his laundry.  When he is finally out of clothes,
he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain
of clothes to the laundromat.  Men always expect to meet beautiful women at
the laundromat.  This is a myth.

Nicknames:
	If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle get together for lunch,
they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle.  But if
Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately
refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut Brain and Useless.

Socks:
	Men wear sensible socks.  They wear standard white sweatsocks.
Women wear strange socks.  They are cut way below the ankles, have pictures
of clouds on them, and have a big fuzzy ball on the back.

		<string>			-- Gifts for Men --

Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional ice
hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you should
never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes they
will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example, your average
man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,
through humiliating trial and error, that if he wears any of the other 81
ties, his wife will probably laugh at him (&quot;You&apos;re not going to wear THAT
tie with that suit, are you?&quot;). So he has narrowed it down to three safe
ties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give him
a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.

If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.  More than
once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of tires.

and romances came and went, and I eventually ended up settling for someone
a lot less than my idea of perfection.  But one day, after many years
together, I lay there on our bed recovering from a slight illness.  My
wife was sitting on a chair next to the bed, humming softly and watching
the late afternoon sun filtering through the trees.  The only sounds to
be heard elsewhere were the clock ticking, the kettle downstairs starting
to boil, and an occasional schoolchild passing beneath our window.  And
as I looked up into my wife&apos;s now wrinkled face, but still warm and
twinkling eyes, I realized something about perfection...  It comes only
with time.

		<string>	It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.  Your parents will
not be pleased with this plan, because they want you all to themselves and
because in the presence of your friend, they will have to act like mature
human beings.
	The worst kind of friend to take home is a girl, because in that case,
there is the potential that your parents will lose you not just for the 
duration of the visit but forever.  The worst kind of girl to take home is one
of a different religion:  Not only will you be lost to your parents forever but
you will be lost to a woman who is immune to their religious/moral arguments
and whose example will irretrievably corrupt you.
	Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve fallen in love with just such a girl and would like
to take her home for the holidays.  You are aware of your parents&apos; xenophobic
response to anyone of a different religion.  How to prepare them for the shock?
	Simple.  Call them up shortly before your visit and tell them that you
have gotten quite serious about somebody who is of a different religion, a
different race and the same sex.  Tell them you have already invited this
person to meet them.  Give the information a moment to sink in and then 
remark that you were only kidding, that your lover is merely of a different
religion.  They will be so relieved they will welcome her with open arms.

		<string>It is explained that all relationships require a little give and take.  This

		<string>It is most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his

		<string>It is not necessary to inquire whether a woman would like something for
dessert.  The answer is yes, she would like something for dessert, but
she would like you to order it so she can pick at it with your fork.  She

dessert, why didn&apos;t you order one?&apos;  You must understand, she has the
dessert she wants.  The dessert she wants is contained within yours.

		<string>It was raining heavily, and the motorist had car trouble on a lonely country
road.  Anxious to find shelter for the night, he walked over to a farmhouse
and knocked on the front door.  No one responded.  He could feel the water
from the roof running down the back of his neck as he stood on the stoop.
The next time he knocked louder, but still no answer.  By now he was soaked
to the skin.  Desperately he pounded on the door.  At last the head of a
man appeared out of an upstairs window.
	&quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked gruffly.
	&quot;My car broke down,&quot; said the traveler, &quot;and I want to know if you
would let me stay here for the night.&quot;
	&quot;Sure,&quot; replied the man. &quot;If you want to stay there all night, it&apos;s

		<string>	Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a stroll 
through the woods.  All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seated 
on a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.  &quot;Maiden,&quot; croaked the
frog, &quot;would you do me a favor?  This will be hard for you to believe, but
I was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch cast
a spell over me and turned me into a frog.&quot;
	&quot;Oh, what a pity!&quot;, exclaimed the girl.  &quot;I&apos;ll do anything I can to
help you break such a spell.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; replied the frog, &quot;the only way that this spell can be
taken away is for some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spend
the night under her pillow.&quot;
	The young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath her
pillow that night when she retired.  When she awoke the next morning, sure
enough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly of
royal blood.  And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this day
her father and mother still don&apos;t believe her story.
</string>
		<string>	Once upon a time there were three brothers who were knights
in a certain kingdom.  And, there was a Princess in a neighboring kingdom
who was of marriageable age.  Well, one day, in full armour, their horses,
and their page, the three brothers set off to see if one of them could
win her hand.  The road was long and there were many obstacles along the
way, robbers to be overcome, hard terrain to cross.  As they coped with
each obstacle they became more and more disgusted with their page.  He was
not only inept, he was a coward, he could not handle the horses, he was,
in short, a complete flop.  When they arrived at the court of the kingdom,
they found that they were expected to present the Princess with some
treasure.  The two older brothers were discouraged, since they had not
thought of this and were unprepared.  The youngest, however, had the
answer:  Promise her anything, but give her our page.
</string>
		<string>	One evening he spoke.  Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her,
he allowed his soul to be heard.  &quot;My darling, anything you wish, anything
I am, anything I can ever be...  That&apos;s what I want to offer you -- not the
things I&apos;ll get for you, but the thing in me that will make me able to get
them.  That thing -- a man can&apos;t renounce it -- but I want to renounce it -- so
that it will be yours -- so that it will be in your service -- only for you.&quot;
	The girl smiled and asked: &quot;Do you think I&apos;m prettier than Maggie
Kelly?&quot;
	He got up.  He said nothing and walked out of the house.  He never
saw that girl again.  Gail Wynand, who prided himself on never needing a
lesson twice, did not fall in love again in the years that followed.

		<string>Only two groups of people fall for flattery -- men and women.
</string>
		<string>	People of all sorts of genders are reporting great difficulty,
these days, in selecting the proper words to refer to those of the female
persuasion.
	&quot;Lady,&quot; &quot;woman,&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; are all perfectly good words, but
misapplying them can earn one anything from the charge of vulgarity to a good
swift smack.  We are messing here with matters of deference, condescension,
respect, bigotry, and two vague concepts, age and rank.  It is troubling
enough to get straight who is really what.  Those who deliberately misuse
the terms in a misbegotten attempt at flattery are asking for it.
	A woman is any grown-up female person.  A girl is the un-grown-up
version.  If you call a wee thing with chubby cheeks and pink hair ribbons a
&quot;woman,&quot; you will probably not get into trouble, and if you do, you will be
able to handle it because she will be under three feet tall.  However, if you
call a grown-up by a child&apos;s name for the sake of implying that she has a
youthful body, you are also implying that she has a brain to match.

in his hand.  But is it not true, that you had something in YOUR hand?&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; the man admitted, &quot;his wife. Very charming, of course,
but not much good in a fight.&quot;

		<string>Very few modern women either like or desire marriage, especially after the
ceremony has been performed.  Primarily women wish attention and affection.
Matrimony is something they accept when there is no alternative.  Really,

to a rival.  Husbands, good or bad, always have rivals.  Lovers, never.

		<string>What passes for woman&apos;s intuition is often nothing more than man&apos;s
transparency.

		<string>What publishers are looking for these days isn&apos;t radical feminism.  It&apos;s
corporate feminism -- a brand of feminism designed to sell books and
magazines, three-piece suits, airline tickets, Scotch, cigarettes and,

discriminated against in the past, but that unfortunate mistake has been
remedied; now every woman can attain wealth, prestige and power by dint
of individual rather than collective effort.

		<string>When my freshman roommate at Cornell found out I was Jewish, she was, at
her request, moved to a different room.  She told me she didn&apos;t think she
had ever seen a Jew before.  My only response was to begin wearing a
small Star of David on a chain around my neck.  I had not become a more
observing Jew; rather, discovering that the label of Jew was offensive to
others made me want to let people know who I was and what I believed in.
Similarly, after talking to these young women -- one of whom told me that
she didn&apos;t think she had ever met a feminist -- I&apos;ve taken to identifying
myself as a feminist in the most unlikely of situations.

parties.
	&quot;Oh, I have a three point eight, so I&apos;m much more attracted to the
strong academic types than to the dumb party animals,&quot; she said.  &quot;What&apos;s

</string>
		<string>Woman was taken out of man -- not out of his head, to rule over him; nor

that he might love her.

		<string>	Young men and young women may work systematically six days in the
week and rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend modern dances for
only a few hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka,
Gallop and other dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects
to both sexes.  Health and vigor will vanish like the dew before the sun.
	It is not the extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, but
rather the coming into close contact with the opposite sex.  It is the
fury of lust craving incessantly for more pleasure that undermines the
soul, the body, the sinews and nerves.  Experience and statistics show
beyond doubt that passionate excessive dancing girls can hardly reach
twenty-five years of age and men thirty-one.  Even if they reached that
age they will in most instances be broken in health physically and morally.
This is the claim of prominent physicians in this country.

		<string>A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who 
had ever reached the Enlightenment &apos;Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether 
various objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue 
invariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake, 
and a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and 
asked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop 
between his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex 
string which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk 
was enlightened. 

From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after 
string by Tortue&apos;s method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples, 
who passed it on to theirs.

to add.  This will take at least two weeks,&quot; he finally said.

satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&quot;

holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an
employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!&quot;

gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system
crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the
need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He
has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within
themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has

the Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.  Why
do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?  Computers
simulate determinism; only the Tao is perfect.
	The rules of programming are transitory; only the Tao is eternal.
Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment.&quot;
	&quot;But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?&quot; asked the
novice.
	&quot;Your program will then run correctly,&quot; replied the master.

much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a giant

Why is this so?&quot;
	The master replied, &quot;Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That
company is large because it is so large.  If it only made hardware, nobody
would buy it.  If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a
servant.  But because it combines all of these things, people think it one
of the gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.&quot;

		<string>	A novice asked the master: &quot;In the east there is a great tree-structure
that men call &apos;Corporate Headquarters&apos;.  It is bloated out of shape with
vice-presidents and accountants.  It issues a multitude of memos, each saying
&apos;Go, Hence!&apos; or &apos;Go, Hither!&apos; and nobody knows what is meant.  Every year new
names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail.  How can such an
unnatural entity exist?&quot;
	The master replies: &quot;You perceive this immense structure and are
disturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement from
its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming
beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by its uselessness?&quot;

relied upon to know these things.  He thought for several minutes before
replying.
	&quot;I don&apos;t see why not.  It&apos;s got bloody well everything else.&quot;
	With that, the Chief Priest went to lunch.  The novice suddenly
achieved enlightenment, several years later.

of generalized graphics routines, and artificial intelligence interface,
but not the slightest mention of anything financial.
	When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.
&quot;Don&apos;t be so impatient,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ll put the financial stuff in eventually.&quot;

		<string>A person who is more than casually interested in computers should be well
schooled in machine language, since it is a fundamental part of a computer.
		-- Donald Knuth
</string>
		<string>	A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
strings of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be retained
throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much, neither needless
loops nor useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming
rigidity.
	A program should follow the &apos;Law of Least Astonishment&apos;.  What is this
law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the
way that astonishes him least.
	A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The
program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward
appearances.
	If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite the
program.

		<string>	A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software
conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: &quot;What sort

clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality suites and they
made rude noises during my presentation.&quot;
	The manager said: &quot;I should have never sent you to the conference.
Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life absurd,
an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing limitations.

		<string>	A sheet of paper crossed my desk the other day and as I read it,
realization of a basic truth came over me.  So simple!  So obvious we couldn&apos;t
see it.  John Knivlen, Chairman of Polamar Repeater Club, an amateur radio
group, had discovered how IC circuits work.  He says that smoke is the thing
that makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,
it stops working.  He claims to have verified this with thorough testing.
	I was flabbergasted!  Of course!  Smoke makes all things electrical
work.  Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator
Didn&apos;t it quit working?  I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth
dawned.  It&apos;s the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to
another in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets
the smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor
requires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that&apos;s why the wire
going to it is so large.
	Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas
electronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is
British, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,
British engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and
I might add Brititsh tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks
secrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.

CAR and CDR now return extra values.

The function CAR now returns two values.  Since it has to go to the trouble 
to figure out if the object is carcdr-able anyway, we figured you might as 
well get both halves at once.  For example, the following code shows how to 
destructure a cons (SOME-CONS) into its two slots (THE-CAR and THE-CDR):

	(MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (THE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...)

For symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a second value which is the CAR of the
object.  In a related change, the functions MAKE-ARRAY and CONS have been 
fixed so they don&apos;t allocate any storage except on the stack.  This should
hopefully help people who don&apos;t like using the garbage collector because
it cold boots the machine so often.

LET-OPTIMIZATION area, SETQ the variables and then POP them back when it&apos;s
done.  Don&apos;t worry about this unless you use multiprocessing.
Note that LET *could* have been defined by:

	(LET ((LET &apos;`(LET ((LET &apos;,LET))
			,LET)))
	`(LET ((LET &apos;,LET))
		,LET))

This is believed to speed up execution by as much as a factor of 1.01 or
3.50 depending on whether you believe our friendly marketing representatives.
This code was written by a new programmer here (we snatched him away from
Itty Bitti Machines where he was writing COUGHBOL code) so to give him
confidence we trusted his vows of &quot;it works pretty well&quot; and installed it.

JCL support as alternative to system menu.

In our continuing effort to support languages other than LISP on the CADDR,
we have developed an OS/360-compatible JCL.  This can be used as an
alternative to the standard system menu.  Type System J to get to a JCL
interactive read-execute-diagnose loop window.  [Note that for 360
compatibility, all input lines are truncated to 80 characters.]  This
window also maintains a mouse-sensitive display of critical job parameters
such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channels, etc.  When a JCL
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, the window-oriented JCL
debugger is entered.  The JCL debugger displays appropriate OS/360 error
messages (such as IEC703, &quot;disk error&quot;) and allows you to dequeue your job.

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage 
collection algorithm has been installed.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,
(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when 
virtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-
QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage
collectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather 
than from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly 
more Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like &quot;Do you
remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?&quot;, and if you can&apos;t give a reasonable answer
in thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable 
SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.

		<string>... an anecdote from IBM&apos;s Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a
programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting
down, but he couldn&apos;t log in to the system when he was standing up.  That
behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and
never when standing.

Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal
know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,
know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to
hypothesize: was there a loose with under the carpet, or problems with static
electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.
An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal&apos;s keyboard:
the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a
touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led
astray by hunting and pecking.

allegiance to IBM&apos;s original faith, and denounced the company as a divisive
innovator.  Still, the IBM world is united by its distrust of icons and

		<string>Dear Emily:
	I&apos;m having a serious disagreement with somebody on the net. I
tried complaints to his sysadmin, organizing mail campaigns, called for
his removal from the net and phoning his employer to get him fired.
Everybody laughed at me.  What can I do?
		-- A Concerned Citizen

Dear Concerned:
	Go to the daily papers.  Most modern reporters are top-notch computer
experts who will understand the net, and your problems, perfectly.  They
will print careful, reasoned stories without any errors at all, and surely
represent the situation properly to the public.  The public will also all
act wisely, as they are also fully cognizant of the subtle nature of net
society.
	Papers never sensationalize or distort, so be sure to point out things
like racism and sexism wherever they might exist.  Be sure as well that they
understand that all things on the net, particularly insults, are meant
literally.  Link what transpires on the net to the causes of the Holocaust, if
possible.  If regular papers won&apos;t take the story, go to a tabloid paper --
they are always interested in good stories.

		<string>Dear Emily:
	I&apos;m still confused as to what groups articles should be posted

		-- Still Confused

Dear Still:
	Ok.  Let&apos;s say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think rec.sport.hockey
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a
big trade!  Since it&apos;s a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy
as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try
news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.
	The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.
He is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also
interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to
soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn&apos;t exist, so cross-post to
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as
well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles
there, and a &quot;comp&quot; group will propagate your article further.)
	You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each
group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some newsreaders
will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don&apos;t tolerate this.

		<string>Dear Ms. Postnews:
	I couldn&apos;t get mail through to somebody on another site.  What

		-- Eager Beaver

Dear Eager:
	No problem, just post your message to a group that a lot of people
read.  Say, &quot;This is for John Smith.  I couldn&apos;t get mail through so I&apos;m
posting it.  All others please ignore.&quot;
	This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning
over and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours their collective
time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of checking through usenet
maps or looking for alternate routes.  Just think, if you couldn&apos;t distribute
your message to 9000 other computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call
directory assistance for 60 cents, or even phone the person.  This can cost
as much as a few DOLLARS (!) for a 5 minute call!
	And certainly it&apos;s better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people&apos;s
money distributing the message than for you to have to waste $9 on an overnight
letter, or even 25 cents on a stamp!
	Don&apos;t forget.  The world will end if your message doesn&apos;t get through,
so post it as many places as you can.

		<string>Ever wondered about the origins of the term &quot;bugs&quot; as applied to computer
technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.
The 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in 
computer technology during World War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long
Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-
trators that the first computer &quot;bug&quot; was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard
one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the
&quot;granddaddy&quot; of modern computers, the Mark I.  &quot;Things were going badly;
there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed
computer,&quot; she said.  &quot;Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using
ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when
anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.&quot;  Hopper
said that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, &quot;I referred
them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons
Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in
question.&quot;
		[actually, the term &quot;bug&quot; had even earlier usage in
		regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]

		<string>Fellow programmer, greetings!  You are reading a letter which will bring
you luck and good fortune.  Just mail (or UUCP) ten copies of this letter
to ten of your friends.  Before you make the copies, send a chip or
other bit of hardware, and 100 lines of &apos;C&apos; code to the first person on the
list given at the bottom of this letter.  Then delete their name and add
yours to the bottom of the list.

Don&apos;t break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of San
Diego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next morning to find
his job description changed to &quot;COBOL programmer.&quot;  Fred A. of New York sent
out his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software to
build a Cray dedicated to playing Zork.  Martha H. of Chicago laughed at
this letter and broke the chain.  Shortly thereafter, a fire broke out in
her terminal and she now spends her days writing documentation for IBM PC&apos;s.

Don&apos;t break the chain!  Send out your ten copies today!
For example, if \thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \thickmskip = 6mu.  But if
you also want to use \skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or
not, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule is
that glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \mskip;
when moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor
1mu=1pt is always used.  The meaning of &apos;\mskip\skip12&apos; and
&apos;\baselineskip=\the\thickmskip&apos; should be clear.

		<string>I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and
after expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government
of England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only
commenced, I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even
the offer of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the
reach of men who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...
	If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were
a mere triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the
execution of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some
justification might be found for the course which has been taken; but I
venture to assert that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will
ever publicly express an opinion that such a machine would be useless if
made, and that no man distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to
declare the construction of such machinery impracticable...
	And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed
by that exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its
advancement, which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I
think the application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be
absent -- not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had
developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case.
Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar&apos;s

chased down the error and fixed it.  Now I had improved the program to

		<string>If you ever want to have a lot of fun, I recommend that you go off and program
an imbedded system.  The salient characteristic of an imbedded system is that
it cannot be allowed to get into a state from which only direct intervention
will suffice to remove it.  An imbedded system can&apos;t permanently trust anything
it hears from the outside world.  It must sniff around, adapt, consider, sniff
around, and adapt again.  I&apos;m not talking about ordinary modular programming
carefulness here.  No.  Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted
raging maniacal paranoia.  For example, our ethernet front ends need to know
what network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs
properly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a
gateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network
numbers.  Once you&apos;ve got your network number, you start using it and before
you can blink you&apos;ve got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all
over creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he
was running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong
network number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  Supposing that your
software discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network
number than before, what&apos;s it supposed to do about it?  This is not discussed
in the protocol document.  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  I think you 
get my drift.

	The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they
could write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months,
three more than the schedule allowed.
	The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they
could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating;
it would be well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.
Furthermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling
their thumbs for ten months.
	To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control
program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time,
but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and
it was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual
integrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I would
estimate that it added a year to debugging time.

by staff writers

	...
	The central Superhighway site called ``sunsite.unc.edu&apos;&apos;
collapsed in the morning before the release.  News about the release had
been leaked by a German hacker group, Harmonious Hardware Hackers, who
had cracked into the author&apos;s computer earlier in the week.  They had
got the release date wrong by one day, and caused dozens of eager fans
to connect to the sunsite computer at the wrong time.  ``No computer can
handle that kind of stress,&apos;&apos; explained the mourning sunsite manager,
Erik Troan.  ``The spinning disks made the whole computer jump, and
finally it crashed through the floor to the basement.&apos;&apos;  Luckily,
repairs were swift and the computer was working again the same evening.
``Thank God we were able to buy enough needles and thread and patch it
together without major problems.&apos;&apos;  The site has also installed a new
throttle on the network pipe, allowing at most four clients at the same
time, thus making a new crash less likely.  ``The book is now in our
Incoming folder&apos;&apos;, says Troan, ``and you&apos;re all welcome to come and get it.&apos;&apos;

	The SAG is one of the major products developed via the Information
Superhighway, the brain child of Al Gore, US Vice President.  The ISHW
is being developed with massive govenment funding, since studies show
that it already has more than four hundred users, three years before
the first prototypes are ready.  Asked whether he was worried about the
foreign influence in an expensive American Dream, the vice president
said, ``Finland?  Oh, we&apos;ve already bought them, but we haven&apos;t told

	Rumors about the SAG release have imbalanced the American stock
market for weeks.  Several major publishing houses reached an all time

publishing agreement with Mr. Wirzenius.  The negotiations did not work
out, tough.  ``Not enough dough,&apos;&apos; says the author, although spokesmen
at both Prentice-Hall and Playboy, Inc., claim the author was incapable

by staff writers

Helsinki, Finland, August 6, 1995 -- In a surprise movement, Lars
``Lasu&apos;&apos; Wirzenius today released the 0.3 edition of the ``Linux System
Administrators&apos; Guide&apos;&apos;.  Already an industry non-classic, the new
version sports such overwhelming features as an overview of a Linux
system, a completely new climbing session in a tree, and a list of
acknowledgements in the introduction.
	The SAG, as the book is affectionately called, is one of the
corner stones of the Linux Documentation Project.  ``We at the LDP feel
that we wouldn&apos;t be able to produce anything at all, that all our work
would be futile, if it weren&apos;t for the SAG,&apos;&apos; says Matt Welsh, director
of LDP, Inc.
	The new version is still distributed freely, now even with a
copyright that allows modification.  ``More dough,&apos;&apos; explains the author.
Despite insistent rumors about blatant commercialization, the SAG will
probably remain free.  ``Even more dough,&apos;&apos; promises the author.
	The author refuses to comment on Windows NT and Windows 96
versions, claiming not to understand what the question is about.
Industry gossip, however, tells that Bill Gates, co-founder and CEO of
Microsoft, producer of the Windows series of video games, has visited
Helsinki several times this year.  Despite of this, Linus Torvalds,
author of the word processor Linux with which the SAG was written, is
not worried.  ``We&apos;ll have world domination real soon now, anyway,&apos;&apos; he
explains, ``for 1.4 at the lastest.&apos;&apos;

		<string>	Long ago, in a finite state far away, there lived a JOVIAL
character named Jack.  Jack and his relations were poor.  Often their
hash table was bare.  One day Jack&apos;s parent said to him, &quot;Our matrices
are sparse.  You must go to the market to exchange our RAM for some
BASICs.&quot;  She compiled a linked list of items to retrieve and passed it
to him.
	So Jack set out.  But as he was walking along a Hamilton path,
he met the traveling salesman.
	&quot;Whither dost thy flow chart take thou?&quot; prompted the salesman
in high-level language.
	&quot;I&apos;m going to the market to exchange this RAM for some chips
and Apples,&quot; commented Jack.
	&quot;I have a much better algorithm.  You needn&apos;t join a queue
there; I will swap your RAM for these magic kernels now.&quot;
	Jack made the trade, then backtracked to his house.  But when
he told his busy-waiting parent of the deal, she became so angry she
started thrashing.
	&quot;Don&apos;t you even have any artificial intelligence?  All these

		<string>Norbert Weiner was the subject of many dotty professor stories.  Weiner was, in
fact, very absent minded.  The following story is told about him: when they
moved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely
useless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since
she was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had
moved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to
him.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He
reached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled
some notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and
threw the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the
old address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they
had moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of
paper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There
was a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where
he had moved to, saying, &quot;Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I&apos;m Norbert Weiner
and we&apos;ve just moved.  Would you know where we&apos;ve moved to?&quot;  To which the
young girl replied, &quot;Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.&quot;
	The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the
story) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn&apos;t
quite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,
however, was pretty close to what actually happened...

		<string>	On the other hand, the TCP camp also has a phrase for OSI people.
There are lots of phrases.  My favorite is `nitwit&apos; -- and the rationale
is the Internet philosophy has always been you have extremely bright,
non-partisan researchers look at a topic, do world-class research, do
several competing implementations, have a bake-off, determine what works
best, write it down and make that the standard.
	The OSI view is entirely opposite.  You take written contributions
from a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room of
committee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and all
with their own political axes to grind, and four years later you get
something out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.
	So the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well,
then write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, write
it down, circulate it a lot and now we&apos;ll see if anyone can implement it
after it&apos;s an international standard and every vendor in the world is
committed to it.  One of those processes is backwards, and I don&apos;t think
it takes a Lucasian professor of physics at Oxford to figure out which.

		<string>	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our support for UNIX?
	Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of our
VAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,
easy to get started with. It&apos;s great for students, great for somewhat casual
users, and it&apos;s great for interchanging programs between different machines.
And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run
out of things they can do with UNIX. They&apos;ll want a real system and will end
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
	With UNIX, if you&apos;re looking for something, you can easily and quickly
check that small manual and find out that it&apos;s not there.  With VMS, no matter
what you look for -- it&apos;s literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if
you look long enough it&apos;s there.  That&apos;s the difference -- the beauty of UNIX
is it&apos;s simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it&apos;s all there.

design is that now a system failure can usually be considered to be the
result of two program errors:  the first, in the program that started the
problem; the second, in the recovery routine that could not protect the
system.

My whole being exists in a formless void.  My senses are idle.  My spirit,
free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct.  In short, my program
writes itself.  True, sometimes there are difficult problems.  I see them
coming, I slow down, I watch silently.  Then I change a single line of code
and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the
program.  I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my

Title:		Are Frogs Turing Compatible?
Speaker:	Don &quot;The Lion&quot; Knuth

				ABSTRACT
	Several researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying
the computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problem
of frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas
of computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-
bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size
pond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that
there is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program
to a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable
functions.
	This is not just a let&apos;s-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.
This is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.
	Refreshments will be served.  Music will be played.

	The first student to try to do this was a math student.  &quot;Hmmm...
Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and by induction, we have that all
the odd integers are prime.&quot;
	The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, &quot;I&apos;m not
sure of the validity of your proof, but I think I&apos;ll try to prove it by
experiment.&quot;  He continues, &quot;Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is
prime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13
is prime...  Well, it seems that you&apos;re right.&quot;
	The third student to try it was the engineering student, who responded,
&quot;Well, to be honest, actually, I&apos;m not sure of your answer either.  Let&apos;s
see...  1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...
well, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Well, it
does seem right.&quot;
	Not to be outdone, the computer science student comes along and says
&quot;Well, you two sort&apos;ve got the right idea, but you&apos;ll end up taking too long!
I&apos;ve just whipped up a program to REALLY go and prove it.&quot;  He goes over to
his terminal and runs his program.  Reading the output on the screen he says,
&quot;1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime...&quot;

		<string>***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)

It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge 
in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, 
we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call 
&quot;wisdom engineering&quot;.  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a 
wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  
IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom 
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so 
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic 
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL 
succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed 
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those 
underlying Plato&apos;s theory of government, Kant&apos;s metaphysics, Nietzsche&apos;s theory
of value, and Husserl&apos;s phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe 
IMMANUEL&apos;s achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly 
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

Many of our students have gone on to achieve great success in all fields of
programming.  One former student developed the concept of the personalized
form letter.  Does the phrase, &quot;Dear Mr.(insert name), You may already be a
winner!,&quot; sound familiar?  Another student writes &quot;After only five lessons I
sold a &quot;My Most Unforgettable Program&quot; article to Corrosive Computing magazine.
Another of our graduates writes, &quot;I recently completed a database-management
program for my department manager.  My program touched him so deeply that he
was speechless.  He told me later that he had never seen such a program in
his entire career.  Thank you, Famous Programmers&apos; school; only you could
have made this possible.&quot;  Send for our introductory brochure which explains
in vague detail the operation of the Famous Programmers&apos; School, and you&apos;ll

appropriate to view the host area as a four dimensional hyper-cube, the
four dimensions being cylinder, group, track, and sector.

Referring to our hyper-cube analogy, the set of potentially accessible
blocks form a line parallel to the track axis.  This line moves
parallel to the sector axis, wrapping around when it reaches the edge
of the hyper-cube.

		<string>		The Guy on the Right Doesn&apos;t Stand a Chance
The guy on the right has the Osborne 1, a fully functional computer system
in a portable package the size of a briefcase.  The guy on the left has an
Uzi submachine gun concealed in his attache case.  Also in the case are four
fully loaded, 32-round clips of 125-grain 9mm ammunition.  The owner of the
Uzi is going to get more tactical firepower delivered -- and delivered on
target -- in less time, and with less effort.  All for $795. It&apos;s inevitable.
If you&apos;re going up against some guy with an Osborne 1 -- or any personal 
computer -- he&apos;s the one who&apos;s in trouble.  One round from an Uzi can zip
through ten inches of solid pine wood, so you can imagine what it will do
to structural foam acrylic and sheet aluminum.  In fact, detachable magazines 
for the Uzi are available in 25-, 32-, and 40-round capacities, so you can 
take out an entire office full of Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied
into Ethernet or other local-area networks.  What about the new 16-bit
computers, like the Lisa and Fortune?  Even with the Winchester backup, 
they&apos;re no match for the Uzi.  One quick burst and they&apos;ll find out what

		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE

SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot&apos;s Monopurpose Programming Language
Environment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for
Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code
with errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,
END and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can&apos;t make
a syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.  Thus
they achieve the results of programs written in other languages without
the tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #12: LITHP

This otherwise unremarkable language is distinguished by the absence of
an &quot;S&quot; in its character set; users must substitute &quot;TH&quot;.  LITHP is said
to be useful in protheththing lithtth.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #13: SLOBOL

SLOBOL is best known for the speed, or lack of it, of its compiler.
Although many compilers allow you to take a coffee break while they
compile, SLOBOL compilers allow you to travel to Bolivia to pick the
coffee.  Forty-three programmers are known to have died of boredom
sitting at their terminals while waiting for a SLOBOL program to
compile.  Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to a related (but
infinitely faster) language, COCAINE.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #14 -- VALGOL

	VALGOL is enjoying a dramatic surge of popularity across the
industry.  VALGOL commands include REALLY, LIKE, WELL, and Y*KNOW.
Variables are assigned with the =LIKE and =TOTALLY operators.  Other
operators include the &quot;California booleans&quot;, AX and NOWAY.  Loops are
accomplished with the FOR SURE construct.  A simple example:

	LIKE, Y*KNOW(I MEAN)START
	IF PIZZA	=LIKE BITCHEN AND
	GUY		=LIKE TUBULAR AND
	VALLEY GIRL	=LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2
	THEN
		FOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH*MAYBE 100
			DO*WAH - (DITTY**2); BARF(I)=TOTALLY GROSS(OUT)
		SURE
	LIKE, BAG THIS PROGRAM; REALLY; LIKE TOTALLY(Y*KNOW); IM*SURE
	GOTO THE MALL

	VALGOL is also characterized by its unfriendly error messages.  For
example, when the user makes a syntax error, the interpreter displays the
message GAG ME WITH A SPOON!  A successful compile may be termed MAXIMALLY
AWESOME!
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #15 -- DOGO

	Developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Obedience Training, DOGO
DOGO heralds a new era of computer-literate pets.  DOGO commands include

graphics&quot;, a small cocker spaniel that occasionally leaves a deposit as
it travels across the screen.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #16: C-

This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he
submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is best
described as a &quot;low-level&quot; programming language.  In fact, the language
generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to
execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE

Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely
unstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just are.
Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions. SARTRE
programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH

FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types
refer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and
JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and
BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,
CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.

The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and
financial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include
VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH
and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers
who end up using this language.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #2: RENE

Named after the famous French philosopher and mathematician Rene DesCartes,
RENE is a language used for artificial intelligence.  The language is being
developed at the Chicago Center of Machine Politics and Programming under a
grant from the Jane Byrne Victory Fund.  A spokesman described the language
as &quot;Just as great as dis [sic] city of ours.&quot;

The center is very pleased with progress to date.  They say they have almost
succeeded in getting a VAX to think. However, sources inside the
organization say that each time the machine fails to think it ceases to exist.
</string>
		<string>	THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #8: LAIDBACK

This language was developed at the Marin County Center for T&apos;ai Chi,
Mellowness and Computer Programming (now defunct), as an alternative to
the more intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.

The center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs while
they worked.  Unfortunately few programmers could survive there because the
center outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and Perrier.

Many mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle and
non-threatening language since all error messages are in lower case.  For
example, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the message:

	&quot;i hate to bother you, but i just can&apos;t relate to that.  can
	you find the time to try it again?&quot;

began the magician, &quot;ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating
system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user
interfaces.  It took my assistants several hundred man years to construct.
Is it not amazing?&quot;
	The master raised his eyebrows slightly. &quot;It is indeed amazing,&quot; he
said.
	&quot;Corporate Headquarters has commanded,&quot; continued the magician, &quot;that
everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.  Do you agree
to this?&quot;
	&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the master, &quot;I will have it transported to the
data center immediately!&quot;  And the magician returned to his tower, well
pleased.
	Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master
programmer and said, &quot;I cannot find the listing for my new program.  Do
you know where it might be?&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the master, &quot;the listings are stacked on the platform

		<string>	The salesman and the system analyst took off to spend a weekend in the
forest, hunting bear.  They&apos;d rented a cabin, and, when they got there, took
their backpacks off and put them inside.  At which point the salesman turned
to his friend, and said, &quot;You unpack while I go and find us a bear.&quot;
	Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down
on the porch.  Soon he could hear rustling noises in the forest.  The noises
got nearer -- and louder -- and suddenly there was the salesman, running like
hell across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the largest and
most ferocious grizzly bears the analyst had ever seen.
	&quot;Open the door!&quot;, screamed the salesman.
	The analyst whipped open the door, and the salesman ran to the door,
suddenly stopped, and stepped aside.  The bear, unable to stop, continued
through the door and into the cabin.  The salesman slammed the door closed
and grinned at his friend.  &quot;Got him!&quot;, he exclaimed, &quot;now, you skin this

In the beginning there was data.  The data was without form and null, and
darkness was upon the face of the console; and the Spirit of IBM was moving
over the face of the market.  And DEC said, &quot;Let there be registers;&quot; and
there were registers.  And DEC saw that they carried; and DEC separated the
data from the instructions.  DEC called the data Stack, and the instructions
they called Code.  And there was evening and there was morning, one interrupt

Statically binding, you see only the hierarchy.

Yet magic and hierarchy
arise from the same source,
and this source has a null pointer.

		<string>There has also been some work to allow the interesting use of macro names.
For example, if you wanted all of your &quot;creat()&quot; calls to include read

	I would recommend against this kind of thing in general, since it
hides the changed semantics of &quot;creat()&quot; in a macro, potentially far away
from its uses.
	To allow this use of macros, the preprocessor uses a process that
is worth describing, if for no other reason than that we get to use one of
the more amusing terms introduced into the C lexicon.  While a macro is
being expanded, it is temporarily undefined, and any recurrence of the macro
name is &quot;painted blue&quot; -- I kid you not, this is the official terminology
-- so that in future scans of the text the macro will not be expanded
recursively.  (I do not know why the color blue was chosen; I&apos;m sure it
was the result of a long debate, spread over several meetings.)

	&quot;I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting.  Be
forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.&quot;
	This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions
of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully.
But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself.
	When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,
but nothing was to be found.
	On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the
guard saying: &quot;I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even
better.&quot;  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.
	On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his
curiosity no longer. &quot;Sir Thief,&quot; he said, &quot;I am so perplexed, I cannot live
in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are stealing?&quot;

		<string>	There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: &quot;Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?&quot;
	&quot;An operating system,&quot; replied the programmer.
	The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  &quot;Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating
system,&quot; he said.
	&quot;Not so,&quot; said the programmer, &quot;when designing an accounting package,
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design.&quot;

which is easier to debug?&quot;

share my resources with anyone.  The software is self-consistent and
easy-to-use.  Why do you not quit your present job and join me here?&quot;
	The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his
friend, saying: &quot;The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the
midst of the data center.  Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean
of machinery.  The software is a multi-faceted as a diamond and as convoluted
as a primeval jungle.  The programs, each unique, move through the system
like a swift-flowing river.  That is why I am happy where I am.&quot;

two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.

Hughes, sought to gain control of the voter registration lists kept in
her home.  Masking her fear and thinking fast, Mrs. Chine quickly divided
a nearby apple in two and deftly stored the list in its center.  Upon
entering, the British blatantly violated every conceivable convention,
and, though they went through the house virtually bit by bit, their
search was fruitless.  They had to return empty handed.  Word of the
incident propagated rapidly through the region.  This historic event
became the first documented use of core storage for the saving of registers.

		<string>Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. 
to 64 oz.  Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even 
though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical. 
Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have 
to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you 
either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been 
drinking Unix Beer for several years.
	BSD stout: Deep, hearty, and an acquired taste.  The official
brewer has released the recipe, and a lot of home-brewers now use it.
	Hurd beer: Long advertised by the popular and politically active
GNU brewery, so far it has more head than body.  The GNU brewery is
mostly known for printing complete brewing instructions on every can,
which contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.
	Linux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his
basement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious
brewers and Unix beer-lovers worldwide, many of whom change the recipe.
	POSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the
newer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.
	Solaris brand: A lager, intended to replace Sun brand stout.
Unlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.
	Sun brand: Long the most popular stout on the Unix market, it was
discontinued in favor of a lager.
	SysV lager: Clear and thirst-quenching, but lacking the body of
stout or the sweetness of ale.

For those of you in the reseller business, here is a helpful tip that will
save your support staff a few hours of precious time.  Before you send your
next machine out to an untrained client, change the permissions on /etc/passwd
to 666 and make sure there is a copy somewhere on the disk.  Now when they
forget the root password, you can easily login as an ordinary user and correct
the damage.  Having a bootable tape (for larger machines) is not a bad idea
either.  If you need some help, give us a call.

		<string>WARNING!!!
This machine is subject to breakdowns during periods of critical need.

A special circuit in the machine called &quot;critical detector&quot; senses the
operator&apos;s emotional state in terms of how desperate he/she is to use the
machine.  The &quot;critical detector&quot; then creates a malfunction proportional
to the desperation of the operator.  Threatening the machine with violence
only aggravates the situation.  Likewise, attempts to use another machine
may cause it to malfunction.  They belong to the same union.  Keep cool
and say nice things to the machine.  Nothing else seems to work.

		<string>&quot;We invented a new protocol and called it Kermit, after Kermit the Frog,
star of &quot;The Muppet Show.&quot; [3]

[3]  Why?  Mostly because there was a Muppets calendar on the wall when we
were trying to think of a name, and Kermit is a pleasant, unassuming sort of
character.  But since we weren&apos;t sure whether it was OK to name our protocol
after this popular television and movie star, we pretended that KERMIT was an
acronym; unfortunately, we could never find a good set of words to go with the
letters, as readers of some of our early source code can attest.  Later, while
looking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed
that &quot;Kermit&quot; was a Celtic word for &quot;free&quot;, which is what all Kermit programs
should be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our
source code (Bill&apos;s baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky
instead).  When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article for
publication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permission
to say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.  Permission
was kindly granted, and now the real story can be told.  I resisted the
temptation, however, to call the present work &quot;Kermit the Book.&quot;

		<string>Welcome to UNIX!  Enjoy your session!  Have a great time!  Note the
use of exclamation points!  They are a very effective method for
demonstrating excitement, and can also spice up an otherwise plain-looking
sentence!  However, there are drawbacks!  Too much unnecessary exclaiming
can lead to a reduction in the effect that an exclamation point has on
the reader!  For example, the sentence

	Jane went to the store to buy bread

should only be ended with an exclamation point if there is something
sensational about her going to the store, for example, if Jane is a
cocker spaniel or if Jane is on a diet that doesn&apos;t allow bread or if
Jane doesn&apos;t exist for some reason!  See how easy it is?!  Proper control
of exclamation points can add new meaning to your life!  Call now to receive

		<string>At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seemingly
contradictory attitudes -- an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre
or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny
of all ideas, old and new.  This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep
nonsense.  Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to understand the
world, but there is a built-in error-correcting mechanism:  The collective
enterprise of creative thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps the
field on track.

		<string>One of the saddest lessons of history is this:  If we&apos;ve been bamboozled
long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.  We&apos;re no
longer interested in finding out the truth.  The bamboozle has captured
us.  it is simply too painful to acknowledge -- even to ourselves -- that
we&apos;ve been so credulous.  (So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the
new bamboozles rise.)

		<string>The inability to benefit from feedback appears to be the primary cause of
pseudoscience.  Pseudoscientists retain their beliefs and ignore or distort

scientists must employ in their work.

threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.

The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write
the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more
than the schedule allowed.

The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare
the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be 
well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if
the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs
for ten months.

To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program
team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would
also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He
was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made
the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it
added a year to debugging time.

		<string>The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in contemoprary
psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven fruitful...After
more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist one example of an ESP
phenomenon that is replicable under controlled conditions.  This simple but
basic scientific criterion has not been met despite dozens of studies conducted
over many decades...It is for this reason alone that the topic is now of little
interest to psychology...In short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that
needs explanation.

		<string>I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these
Calculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal
advantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages
for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after
expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of
England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only commenced,
I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even the offer
of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men
who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...  

If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere
triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution
of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification
might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert
that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express
an opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man
distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of
such machinery impracticable...

And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that
exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,
which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the 
application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse
calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.
In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not
be economized by the aid of machinery.

		<string>I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It&apos;s a
very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroom
everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, or
at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade,
and it&apos;s not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach
much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense
of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor
popularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.

		<string>If science were explained to the average person in a way that is accessible
and exciting, there would be no room for pseudoscience.  But there is a kind
of Gresham&apos;s Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out the
good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community
ourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, the
media, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper
in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly
astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational
system.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure that
may even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the human
future.

		<string>The characteristic property of hallucinogens, to suspend the boundaries between

I see the true importance of LSD in the possibility of providing materail aid

		<string>I share the belief of many of my contemporaries that the spiritual crisis
pervading all spheres of Western industrial society can be remedied only 
by a change in our world view.  We shall have to shift from the materialistic,

new conciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces the 
experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their oneness with animate 
nature and all of creation.
- Dr. Albert Hoffman
</string>
		<string>Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and related
hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences, entails
dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take into
account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The history
of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that can
ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken
for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preperations
are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful
experience.

There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between

looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice
is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious
mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can&apos;t be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

		<string>The challenge of space exploration and particularly of landing men on the moon
represents the greatest challenge which has ever faced the human race.  Even
if there were no clear scientific or other arguments for proceeding with this
task, the whole history of our civilization would still impel men toward the
goal.  In fact, the assembly of the scientific and military with these human
arguments creates such an overwhelming case that in can be ignored only by
those who are blind to the teachings of history, or who wish to suspend the
development of civilization at its moment of greatest opportunity and drama.

honest with ourselves, we must admit that we needed that impetus extremely
strongly.  I sincerely believe that the space program, with its manned
landing on the moon, if wisely executed, will become the spearhead for a
broad front of courageous and energetic activities in all the fields of
endeavour of the human mind - activities which could not be carried out

		<string>The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only
opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts
at rational thinking.  Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of
knowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable.  Since the earliest
days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
effort to liberate the body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and
everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad
laws, bad social theories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an
apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.

		<string>The notion that science does not concern itself with first causes -- that it
leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere 
effects -- this notion has no support in the plain facts.  If it could,
science would explain the origin of life on earth at once--and there is 
every reason to believe that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow.
To argue that gaps in knowledge which will confront the seeker must be filled,
not by patient inquiry, but by intuition or revelation, is simply to give
ignorance a gratuitous and preposterous dignity....

		<string>The evidence of the emotions, save in cases where it has strong objective
support, is really no evidence at all, for every recognizable emotion has
its opposite, and if one points one way then another points the other way.
Thus the familiar argument that there is an instinctive desire for immortality,
and that this desire proves it to be a fact, becomes puerile when it is
recalled that there is also a powerful and widespread fear of annihilation,
and that this fear, on the same principle proves that there is nothing
beyond the grave.  Such childish &quot;proofs&quot; are typically theological, and
they remain theological even when they are adduced by men who like to 
flatter themselves by believing that they are scientific gents....

		<string>The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events, the firmer
becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered
regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him neither the rule of
human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural
events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural
events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this
doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge
has not yet been able to set foot.

But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives
of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine which 
is able to maintain itself not in clear light, but only in the dark, will
of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human
progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion
must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, 
give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast
powers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail
themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the 
True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a more
difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.

Is it not a spectacle to make the angels laugh?  We are a company of
ignorant beings, feeling our way through mists and darkness, learning only
be incessantly repeated blunders, obtaining a glimmering of truth by
falling into every conceivable error, dimly discerning light enough for 
our daily needs, but hopelessly differing whenever we attempt to describe
the ultimate origin or end of our paths; and yet, when one of us ventures
to declare that we don&apos;t know the map of the universe as well as the map
of our infintesimal parish, he is hooted, reviled, and perhaps told that
he will be damned to all eternity for his faithlessness...

		<string>However, on religious issures there can be little or no compromise.
There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious
beliefs.  There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than
Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.
But like any powerful weapon, the use of God&apos;s name on one&apos;s behalf
should be used sparingly.  The religious factions that are growing
throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom.
They are trying to force government leaders into following their position
100 percent.  If you disagree with these religious groups on a 
particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of
money or votes or both.  I&apos;m frankly sick and tired of the political
preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be
a moral person, I must believe in &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C,&quot; and &quot;D.&quot;  Just who do
they think they are?  And from where do they presume to claim the 
right to dictate their moral beliefs to me?  And I am even more angry as
a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who
thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll
call in the Senate.  I am warning them today:  I will fight them every

Americans in the name of &quot;conservatism.&quot;

		<string>...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their 
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
are frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.

		<string>As I argued in &quot;Beloved Son&quot;, a book about my son Brian and the subject

in the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless
conversions -- to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and
has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The 
problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and 
irrational -- the powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in 
changing the believer&apos;s mind.

Christians to agree among themselves about their relationship to God.
But all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual
resources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further
proposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,
the Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and
they themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and
think; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that
much closer to a truly religious situation on earth.

		<string>If one inquires why the American tradition is so strong against any
connection of State and Church, why it dreads even the rudiments of

The cause lay largely in the diversity and vitality of the various
denominations, each fairly sure that, with a fair field and no favor,
it could make its own way; and each animated by a jealous fear that,
if any connection of State and Church were permitted, some rival
denomination would get an unfair advantage.

		<string>Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered 
samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to 
common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
any such &quot;show-down&quot; is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; 
authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary 
ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The &quot;religious&quot;
would be the last to be willing that either the history of the
content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those
to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against
its being taught in any other spirit.
- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher, 
  from &quot;Democracy in the Schools&quot;, 1908
</string>
		<string>In the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the
sense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities
and disabilities that constitute a concrete personality...Whether this
educative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non-

not only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the
interests and activites of a society that is committed to the democratic
way of life.

to introduce the strong central government that we now know.  But in most

strong.  I think, barring a series of catastrophic events, that we can

		<string>Two things are certain about science.  It does not stand still for long,
and it is never boring.  Oh, among some poor souls, including even
intellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequently
misperceived.  Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from
on high in must, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of unchanging
precepts defended with authoritarian vigor.  Others view it as nothing
but a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific
method: hidebound, linear, and left brained.

These people are the victims of their own stereotypes.  They are
destined to view the world of science with a set of blinders.  They
know nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and 
tendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the 
creativity, passion, and joy of discovery.  And they are likely to
know little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveries
that every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of the
natural world.

		<string>I did cancel one performance in Holland where they thought my music was so easy
that they didn&apos;t rehearse at all.  And so the first time when I found that out,
I rehearsed the orchestra myself in front of the audience of 3,000 people and
the next day I rehearsed through the second movement -- this was the piece
_Cheap Imitation_ -- and they then were ashamed.  The Dutch people were ashamed
and they invited me to come to the Holland festival and they promised to
rehearse.  And when I got to Amsterdam they had changed the orchestra, and
again, they hadn&apos;t rehearsed.  So they were no more prepared the second time
than they had been the first.  I gave them a lecture and told them to cancel
the performance; they then said over the radio that i had insisted on their
cancelling the performance because they were &quot;insufficiently Zen.&quot;

		<string>Inadmissible:  Not competent to be considered.  Said of certain kinds of
testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with,
and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves
alone.  Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was
unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous 
actions, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, are
daily undertaken on hearsay evidence.  There is no religion in the world
that has any other basis than hearsay evidence.  Revelation is hearsay
evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the
testimony of men long dead whose identy is not clearly established and
who are not known to have been sworn in any sense.  Under the rules of
evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law...

But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be proved
that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to
mankind.  The evidence (including confession) upon which certain women
were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still
unimpeachable.  The judges&apos; decisions based on it were sound in logic and
in law.  Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than
the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death.
If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are alike
destitute of value.  --Ambrose Bierce

		<string>&quot;I have a friend who just got back from the Soviet Union, and told me the people
there are hungry for information about the West.  He was asked about many 
things, but I will give you two examples that are very revealing about life in
the Soviet Union.  The first question he was asked was if we had exploding
television sets.  You see, they have a problem with the picture tubes on color
television sets, and many are exploding.  They assumed we must be having 
problems with them too.  The other question he was asked often was why the
CIA had killed Samantha Smith, the little girl who visited the Soviet Union a
few years ago; their propaganda is very effective.

		<string>&quot;...I could accept this openness, glasnost, perestroika, or whatever you want
to call it if they did these things: abolish the one party system; open the
Soviet frontier and allow Soviet people to travel freely; allow the Soviet
people to have real free enterprise; allow Western businessmen to do business
there, and permit freedom of speech and of the press.  But so far, the whole
country is like a concentration camp.  The barbed wire on the fence around
the Soviet Union is to keep people inside, in the dark.  This openness that
you are seeing, all these changes, are cosmetic and they have been designed
to impress shortsighted, naive, sometimes stupid Western leaders.  These
leaders gush over Gorbachev, hoping to do business with the Soviet Union or
appease it.  He will say: &quot;Yes, we can do business!&quot;  This while his
military machine in Afghanistan has killed over a million people out of a
population of 17 million.  Can you imagine that?

</string>
		<string>&quot;In corporate life, I think there are three important areas which contracts
can&apos;t deal with, the area of conflict, the area of change and area of reaching
potential.  To me a covenant is a relationship that is based on such things
as shared ideals and shared value systems and shared ideas and shared
agreement as to the processes we are going to use for working together.  In
many cases they develop into real love relationships.&quot;

don&apos;t want subordinates to do their best, because it gets to be very

designers if we are willing to have this kind of relationship and if we&apos;re
willing to be vulnerable to what will come out of it, we get really good
work.&quot;

Nelson if he really wanted to share the limited opportunities of a then-small
company with another designer.  &quot;George&apos;s response was something like this:
&apos;Charles Eames is an unusual talent.  He is very different from me.  The

		<string>Mr. DePree also expects a &quot;tremendous social change&quot; in all workplaces.  &quot;When
I first started working 40 years ago, a factory supervisor was focused on the
product.  Today it is drastically different, because of the social milieu.
It isn&apos;t unusual for a worker to arrive on his shift and have some family
problem that he doesn&apos;t know how to resolve.  The example I like to use is a
guy who comes in and says &apos;this isn&apos;t going to be a good day for me, my son
is in jail on a drunk-driving charge and I don&apos;t know how to raise bail.&apos;
What that means is that if the supervisor wants productivity, he has to know
how to raise bail.&quot;

		<string>&quot;The stars are made of the same atoms as the earth.&quot;  I usually pick one small
topic like this to give a lecture on.  Poets say science takes away from the
beauty of the stars -- mere gobs of gas atoms.  Nothing is &quot;mere.&quot;  I too can
see the stars on a desert night, and feel them.  But do I see less or more?
The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination -- stuck on this carousel
my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.  A vast pattern -- of which
I am a part -- perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one
is belching there.  Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together.
What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?*  It does not do harm to the 
mystery to know a little about it.  For far more marvelous is the truth than
any artists of the past imagined!  Why do the poets of the present not speak
of it?  What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but
if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?

		<string>&quot;Pseudocode can be used to some extent to aid the maintenance
process.  However, pseudocode that is highly detailed -
approaching the level of detail of the code itself - is not of
much use as maintenance documentation.  Such detailed
documentation has to be maintained almost as much as the code,
thus doubling the maintenance burden.  Furthermore, since such
voluminous pseudocode is too distracting to be kept in the
listing itself, it must be kept in a separate folder.  The
result: Since pseudocode - unlike real code - doesn&apos;t have to be
maintained, no one will maintain it.  It will soon become out of
date and everyone will ignore it.  (Once, I did an informal
survey of 42 shops that used pseudocode.  Of those 42, 0 [zero!],
found that it had any value as maintenance documentation.&quot;

		<string>An Animal that knows who it is, one that has a sense of his own identity, is
a discontented creature, doomed to create new problems for himself for the
duration of his stay on this planet.  Since neither the mouse nor the chimp
knows what is, he is spared all the vexing problems that follow this
discovery.  But as soon as the human animal who asked himself this question
emerged, he plunged himself and his descendants into an eternity of doubt
and brooding, speculation and truth-seeking that has goaded him through the
centures as reelentlessly as hunger or sexual longing.  The chimp that does
not know that he exists is not driven to discover his origins and is spared
the tragic necessity of contemplating his own end.  And even if the animal 
experimenters succeed in teaching a chimp to count one hundred bananas or 
to play chess, the chimp will develop no science and he will exhibit no 
appreciation of beauty, for the greatest part of man&apos;s wisdom may be traced
back to the eternal questions of beginnings and endings, the quest to give
meaning to his existence, to life itself.

		<string>    UNIX Shell is the Best Fourth Generation Programming Language

    It is the UNIX shell that makes it possible to do applications in a small 
    fraction of the code and time it takes in third generation languages.  In 
    the shell you process whole files at a time, instead of only a line at a 
    time.  And, a line of code in the UNIX shell is one or more programs,
    which do more than pages of instructions in a 3GL.  Applications can be
    developed in hours and days, rather than months and years with traditional
    systems.  Most of the other 4GLs available today look more like COBOL or
    RPG, the most tedious of the third generation lanaguages.

		<string>&quot;A commercial, and in some respects a social, doubt has been started within the
 last year or two, whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security
 or insecurity of locks.  Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discus-
 sion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a
 premium for dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest.  This is a fal-
 lacy.  Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much more
 than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.  Rogues knew
 a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among them-
 selves, as they have lately done.  If a lock -- let it have been made in what-
 ever country, or by whatever maker -- is not so inviolable as it has hitherto
 been deemed to be, surely it is in the interest of *honest* persons to know
 this fact, because the *dishonest* are tolerably certain to be the first to
 apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of knowledge is necessary to
 give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.  It cannot be too ear-
 nestly urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better
 for all parties.&quot;
-- Charles Tomlinson&apos;s Rudimentary Treatise on the Construction of Locks,

</string>
		<string> In respect to lock-making, there can scarcely be such a thing as dishonesty 
 of intention: the inventor produces a lock which he honestly thinks will 
 possess such and such qualities; and he declares his belief to the world.
 If others differ from him in opinion concerning those qualities, it is open
 to them to say so; and the discussion, truthfully conducted, must lead to
 public advantage: the discussion stimulates curiosity, and curiosity stimu-
 lates invention.  Nothing but a partial and limited view of the question
 could lead to the opinion that harm can result: if there be harm, it will be
 much more than counterbalanced by good.&quot;

		<string>First as to speech.  That privilege rests upon the premise that
there is no proposition so uniformly acknowledged that it may not be
lawfully challenged, questioned, and debated.  It need not rest upon
the further premise that there are no propositions that are not
open to doubt; it is enough, even if there are, that in the end it is
worse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.  Hence it
has been again and again unconditionally proclaimed that there are
no limits to the privilege so far as words seek to affect only the hearers&apos;
beliefs and not their conduct.  The trouble is that conduct is almost
always based upon some belief, and that to change the hearer&apos;s belief
will generally to some extent change his conduct, and may even evoke
conduct that the law forbids.

   excerpts from a discussion on Astrology and Reagan
</string>
		<string>The reported resort to astrology in the White House has occasioned much
merriment.  It is not funny.  Astrological gibberish, which means astrology
generally, has no place in a newspaper, let alone government.  Unlike comics,
which are part of a newspaper&apos;s harmless pleasure and make no truth claims,
astrology is a fraud.  The idea that it gets a hearing in government is
dismaying.
-- George Will, Washing Post Writers Group
</string>
		<string>Astrology is the sheerest hokum.  This pseudoscience has been around since
the day of the Chaldeans and Babylonians.  It is as phony as numerology,
phrenology, palmistry, alchemy, the reading of tea leaves, and the practice
of divination by the entrails of a goat.  No serious person will buy the
notion that our lives are influenced individually by the movement of
distant planets.  This is the sawdust blarney of the carnival midway.
-- James J. Kilpatrick, Universal Press Syndicate
</string>
		<string>A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believer
in the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughter
is that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward
science.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we&apos;ve all come to
accept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not
that long ago, it was Reagan&apos;s support of Creationism....Creationists actually
got equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded
to the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were
scientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president
is averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American
turf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns
into a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.  The same
people who doubt experts can also believe any quackery, from the benefits of
laetrile to eye of newt to the movment of planets.  We lose the capacity to
make rational -- scientific -- judgments.  It&apos;s all the same.
-- Ellen Goodman, The Boston Globe Newspaper Company-Washington Post Writers 
    Group
</string>
		<string>The spectacle of astrology in the White House -- the governing center of
the world&apos;s greatest scientific and military power -- is so appalling that
it defies understanding and provides grounds for great fright.  The easiest
response is to laugh it off, and to indulge in wisecracks about Civil
Service ratings for horoscope makers and palm readers and whether Reagan
asked Mikhail Gorbachev for his sign.  A contagious good cheer is the
hallmark of this presidency, even when the most dismal matters are concerned.
But this time, it isn&apos;t funny.  It&apos;s plain scary.

   &quot;Newsday&quot;, May 5, 1988

		<string>[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this
belief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We&apos;re dealing with
beliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There&apos;s nothing there....
It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It&apos;s got technical
terms.  It&apos;s got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite
glib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from
metaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The
fact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that
should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They
have not proved their case....It&apos;s just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there&apos;s
no theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It&apos;s been tested
and tested over the centuries.  Nobody&apos;s ever found any validity to it at
all.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it
has to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --
you test it.  And in that astrology is reqlly quite something else.
-- Astronomer Richard Berendzen, President, American University, on ABC
    News &quot;Nightline,&quot; May 3, 1988
</string>
		<string>Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about
astrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.
Why would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an
effect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,
what sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human
beings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding
jargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central
problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which
celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .
Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents
the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those
of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always
claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their
efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have
generously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed
tests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .
I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest
in the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them
keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by
the firelight, afraid of the night.

		<string>With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning
her husband&apos;s schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles
on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and
astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and
technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such
happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations
of a well-established &quot;anti-science&quot; tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,
could threaten the country&apos;s position as a technological power. . . .  The
manifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series
of quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur
well for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its
industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a 
significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance
of and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching
truth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up
soon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of
maintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,
with a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not
suffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.

be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to
insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as

receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this

      him in feminine attire but instead I pressed his margin release
      over and over again until the typewriter lost consciousness.
      Presently, I regained consciousness and realized with shame what

		<string>&quot;Despite its suffix, skepticism is not an &quot;ism&quot; in the sense of a belief
or dogma.  It is simply an approach to the problem of telling what is
counterfeit and what is genuine.  And a recognition of how costly it may
be to fail to do so.  To be a skeptic is to cultivate &quot;street smarts&quot; in
the battle for control of one&apos;s own mind, one&apos;s own money, one&apos;s own
allegiances.  To be a skeptic, in short, is to refuse to be a victim.

		<string>	Well, punk is kind of anti-ethical, anyway.  Its ethics, so to speak,
include a disdain for ethics in general.  If you have to think about some-
thing so hard, then it&apos;s bullshit anyway; that&apos;s the idea.  Punks are anti-
ismists, to coin a term.  But nonetheless, they have a pretty clearly defined
stance and image, and THAT is what we hang the term `punk&apos; on.

		<string>	I think for the most part that the readership here uses the c-word in
a similar fashion.  I don&apos;t think anybody really believes in a new, revolution-
ary literature --- I think they use `cyberpunk&apos; as a term of convenience to
discuss the common stylistic elements in a small subset of recent sf books.
-- Jeff G. Bone
</string>
		<string>	So we get to my point.  Surely people around here read things that
aren&apos;t on the *Officially Sanctioned Cyberpunk Reading List*.  Surely we
don&apos;t (any of us) really believe that there is some big, deep political and
philosophical message in all this, do we?  So if this `cyberpunk&apos; thing is
just a term of convenience, how can somebody sell out?  If cyberpunk is just a
word we use to describe a particular style and imagery in sf, how can it be
dead?  Where are the profound statements that the `Movement&apos; is or was trying
to make?
	I think most of us are interested in examining and discussing literary
(and musical) works that possess a certain stylistic excellence and perhaps a
rather extreme perspective; this is what CP is all about, no?  Maybe there 
should be a newsgroup like, say, alt.postmodern or somthing.  Something less
restrictive in scope than alt.cyberpunk.

		<string>...cyberpunk wants to see the mind as mechanistic &amp; duplicable,

observation that the real art was the building of the machine itself,

		<string>It might be worth reflecting that this group was originally created

original announcement for the group called for an all inclusive
discussion ranging from the writings of Gibson and Vinge and movies
like Bladerunner to real world things like Brands&apos; description of the
work being done at the MIT Media Lab.  It was meant as a haven for
people with vision of this scope.  If you want to create a haven for
people with narrower visions, feel free.  But I feel sad for anyone
who thinks that alt.cyberpunk is such a monstrous group that it is in
dire need of being subdivided.  Heaven help them if they ever start

   an asshole the target it. We cannot be convinced to flame Dennis
   Ritchie. Matt Crawford flames are free.

2) For a negotiated price (same arrangement) the TETflame programme
   is offering ``flame insurence&apos;&apos;. Under this arrangement, if
   one of our policy holders is flamed, we will cancel the offending
   article and flame the flamer, to a crisp.

3) The TETflame flaming representatives include: Richard Sexton, Oleg
   Kisalev, Diane Holt, Trish O&apos;Tauma, Dave Hill, Greg Nowak and our most
   recent aquisition, Keith Doyle. But all he will do is put you in his
   kill file. Weemba by special arrangement.

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 1

proof by example:
	The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it 
	contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

proof by intimidation:
	&apos;Trivial&apos;.

proof by vigorous handwaving:
	Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 2

proof by cumbersome notation:
	Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
	symbols.

proof by exhaustion:
	An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.

proof by omission:
	&apos;The reader may easily supply the details&apos;
	&apos;The other 253 cases are analogous&apos;
	&apos;...&apos; 

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 3

proof by obfuscation:
	A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless 
	syntactically related statements.

proof by wishful citation:
	The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of 
	a theorem from the literature to support his claims.

proof by funding:
	How could three different government agencies be wrong?

proof by eminent authority:
	&apos;I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
	complete.&apos; 

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 4

proof by personal communication:
	&apos;Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete 
	[Karp, personal communication].&apos; 

proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
	&apos;To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is 
	decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.&apos; 

proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
	The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found 
	in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian 
	Philological Society, 1883.

proof by importance:
	A large body of useful consequences all follow from the 
	proposition in question.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 5

proof by accumulated evidence:
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.

proof by metaproof:
	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The 
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these 
	techniques.
</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 6

proof by picture:
	A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well 
	with proof by omission.

proof by vehement assertion:
	It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the 
	audience.

proof by ghost reference:
	Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in 
	the reference given.

</string>
		<string>			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 7
proof by forward reference:
	Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, 
	which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

proof by semantic shift:
	Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed 
	for the statement of the result.

proof by appeal to intuition:
	Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.

would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be interested.  This is a
big trade!  Since it&apos;s a NEWS article, it belongs in the news.* hierarchy
as well.  If you are a news admin, or there is one on your machine, try
news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.

The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.  He is
a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are also
interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post to
soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn&apos;t exist, so cross-post to
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as
well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles
there, and a &quot;comp&quot; group will propagate your article further.)

You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each group.

only show the the article to the reader once!  Don&apos;t tolerate this.

		<string>		     THE &quot;FUN WITH USENET&quot; MANIFESTO
Very little happens on Usenet without some sort of response from some other 
reader.  Fun With Usenet postings are no exception.  Since there are some who 
might question the rationale of some of the excerpts included therein, I have 
written up a list of guidelines that sum up the philosophy behind these 
postings.

	One.  I never cut out words in the middle of a quote without a VERY 
good reason, and I never cut them out without including ellipses.  For 
instance, &quot;I am not a goob&quot; might become &quot;I am ... a goob&quot;, but that&apos;s too 
mundane to bother with.  &quot;I&apos;m flame proof&quot; might (and has) become 
&quot;I&apos;m ...a... p...oof&quot; but that&apos;s REALLY stretching it.

	Two.  If I cut words off the beginning or end of a quote, I don&apos;t
put ellipses, but neither do I capitalize something that wasn&apos;t capitalized
before the cut. &quot;I don&apos;t think that the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful
place&quot; would turn into &quot;the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful place&quot;.  Imagine
the posting as a tape-recording of the poster&apos;s thoughts.  If I can set
up the quote via fast-forwarding and stopping the tape, and without splicing,
I don&apos;t put ellipses in.  And by the way, I love using this mechanism for
turning things around.  If you think something stinks, say so - don&apos;t say you
don&apos;t think it&apos;s wonderful.   ...

		<string>I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of 
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use 
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, 
such as &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I 
conceive&quot;, &quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it 
appears to me at present&quot;.

When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the 
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some 
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in 
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.

I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I 
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my 
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had 
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily 
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I 
happened to be in the right.

to be so outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn&apos;t understand
hat was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.  He was reknowned for 
being quite clever and quite clearly was so -- but not all the time, which
obviously worried him, hence the act.  He preferred people to be puzzled

genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about.

job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing 
forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a 
state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the

		<string>After this was written there appeared a remarkable posthumous memoir that
throws some doubt on Millikan&apos;s leading role in these experiments.  Harvey
Fletcher (1884-1981), who was a graduate student at the University of Chicago,
at Millikan&apos;s suggestion worked on the measurement of electronic charge for
his doctoral thesis, and co-authored some of the early papers on this subject
with Millikan.  Fletcher left a manuscript with a friend with instructions
that it be published after his death; the manuscript was published in
Physics Today, June 1982, page 43.  In it, Fletcher claims that he was the
first to do the experiment with oil drops, was the first to measure charges on
single droplets, and may have been the first to suggest the use of oil.
According to Fletcher, he had expected to be co-authored with Millikan on
the crucial first article announcing the measurement of the electronic
charge, but was talked out of this by Millikan.

with firm confidence and a demonstrated mastery of that class of systems,
is ready to build a second system.
	This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.
When he does his third and later ones, his prior experiences will
confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems,

it.  There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between 
prejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you have
looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice
is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious
mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can&apos;t be perfect of course; you
may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you
have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.

	The growth-decay formulas were developed in the trivial fashion by

that would describe a quantity that would dwindle and dwindle, but never
quite reach zero.  Historically, he was merely trying to work out his
mortgage.  Another versatile equation also emerged, one which would define
a function that would continue to grow, but never reach unity.  This equation
can be applied to charging capacitors, over-damped springs, and the human
race in general.

way from San Francisco to Hackensack, New Jersey, although God alone knows
why it would want to.

The five main kinds of electricity are alternating current, direct current,
lightning, static, and European.  Most American homes have alternating
current, which means that the electricity goes in one direction for a while,
then goes in the other direction.  This prevents harmful electron buildup in
the wires.

    if reality disappears?
	Hope this one doesn&apos;t happen to you.  There isn&apos;t much that you

	Explain to your caller, politely but firmly, that being from Jupiter,

	Direct them to the White House lawn, which is where they probably
	wanted to land, anyway.  A good road map should help.

    if you wake up in the middle of the night, and discover that your
    closet contains an alternate dimension?
	Don&apos;t walk in.  You almost certainly will not be able to get back,
	and alternate dimensions are almost never any fun.  Remain calm

lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your

notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?  This
teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never

	It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.  When you scuffed
your feet, you picked up batches of &quot;electrons&quot;, which are very small objects
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.
The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,
where they form a spark that leaps to your friend&apos;s filling, then travels
down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.
	Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without
touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger
would explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you have
carpeting.

	&quot;This,&quot; said the doctor, answering his own question.  &quot;Those queer
things that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable soft
depression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Bogota, in such a way
as to affect his brain.  They are greatly distended, he has eyelashes, and
his eyelids move, and cosequently his brain is in a state of constant
irritation and distraction.&quot;
	&quot;Yes?&quot; said old Yacob.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
	&quot;And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order
to cure him completely, all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical
operation -- namely, to remove those irritant bodies.&quot;
	&quot;And then he will be sane?&quot;
	&quot;Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable citizen.&quot;
	&quot;Thank heaven for science!&quot; said old Yacob.

		<string>I myself have dreamed up a structure intermediate between Dyson spheres
and planets.  Build a ring 93 million miles in radius -- one Earth orbit
-- around the sun.  If we have the mass of Jupiter to work with, and if
we make it a thousand miles wide, we get a thickness of about a thousand
feet for the base.

And it has advantages.  The Ringworld will be much sturdier than a Dyson
sphere.  We can spin it on its axis for gravity.  A rotation speed of 770
m/s will give us a gravity of one Earth normal.  We wouldn&apos;t even need to
roof it over.  Place walls one thousand miles high at each edge, facing the
sun.  Very little air will leak over the edges.

Lord knows the thing is roomy enough.  With three million times the surface
area of the Earth, it will be some time before anyone complains of the
crowding.

into the blueness, and I think as you go farther and farther away from
the reflected light we have from the sun or the light that&apos;s bouncing
off this earth, uh, the darker it gets ... I think if you look at the
color scale, you start at black, move it through purple, move it on
out, it&apos;s the shifting of color.  We mentioned before about the stars

as the eye could see.  So they set out in building a Mathematical edifice that
was to reach up as far as &quot;up&quot; went.  Further and further up they went ...
until one night the edifice collapsed under the weight of paradox.
	The following morning saw only rubble where there once was a huge
structure reaching to the heavens.  One by one, the Mathematicians climbed
out from under the rubble.  It was a miracle that nobody was killed; but when
they began to speak to one another, SUPRISE of all suprises! they could not
understand each other.  They all spoke different languages.  They all fought
amongst themselves and each went about their own way.  To this day the
Topologists remain the original Mathematicians.

which we coffee achievers have long appreciated:  no really creative,
intelligent thought is possible without a good cup of coffee.  On page
14, Hadamard is discussing Poincare&apos;s theory of fuchsian groups and
fuchsian functions, which he describes as &quot;... one of his greatest
discoveries, the first which consecrated his glory ...&quot;  Hadamard refers
to Poincare having had a &quot;... sleepless night which initiated all that
memorable work ...&quot; and gives the following, very revealing quote:

	&quot;One evening, contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and
	could not sleep.  Ideas rose in crowds;  I felt them collide
	until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable
	combination.&quot;

could really have amounted to something as a coffee achiever.

that Walter&apos;s horse has wings&quot; still does not imply &quot;Walter&apos;s horse is a
thing that could have wings&quot;, for perhaps it can only be that Walter&apos;s
horse has wings by Walter having a different horse.  Nor does &quot;Walter&apos;s

an upbeat for science, not as a gloomy epitaph for a noble hope sacrificed on
the alter of human limitations.
	I believe that a factual reality exists and that science, though often
in an obtuse and erratic manner, can learn about it.  Galileo was not shown
the instruments of torture in an abstract debate about lunar motion.  He had
threatened the Church&apos;s conventional argument for social and doctrinal
stability:  the static world order with planets circling about a central

them all together, and if one didn&apos;t fit, why they chipped at it a bit,

		<string>Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group of
us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names of the
smaller prime numbers.

2:  The Odd Prime --
	It&apos;s the only even prime, therefore is odd.  QED.
3:  The True Prime --
	Lewis Carroll: &quot;If I tell you 3 times, it&apos;s true.&quot;
31: The Arbitrary Prime --
	Determined by unanimous unvote.  We needed an arbitrary prime in
	case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.  91 received
	the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the next most.
	However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none at all.
41: The Female Prime --
	The polynomial X**2 - X + 41 is
	prime for integer values from 1 to 40.
43: The Male Prime - they form a prime pair.

Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities
are derived from those primes.  So, for instance, the number 6 is &quot;odd
but true&quot;, while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.

		<string>One day this guy is finally fed up with his middle-class existence and
decides to do something about it.  He calls up his best friend, who is a
mathematical genius.  &quot;Look,&quot; he says, &quot;do you suppose you could find some
way mathematically of guaranteeing winning at the race track?  We could
make a lot of money and retire and enjoy life.&quot;  The mathematician thinks
this over a bit and walks away mumbling to himself.
	A week later his friend drops by to ask the genius if he&apos;s had any
success.  The genius, looking a little bleary-eyed, replies, &quot;Well, yes,
actually I do have an idea, and I&apos;m reasonably sure that it will work, but
there a number of details to be figured out.
	After the second week the mathematician appears at his friend&apos;s house,
looking quite a bit rumpled, and announces, &quot;I think I&apos;ve got it! I still have
some of the theory to work out, but now I&apos;m certain that I&apos;m on the right
track.&quot;
	At the end of the third week the mathematician wakes his friend by
pounding on his door at three in the morning.  He has dark circles under his
eyes.  His hair hasn&apos;t been combed for many days.  He appears to be wearing
the same clothes as the last time.  He has several pencils sticking out from
behind his ears and an almost maniacal expression on his face.  &quot;WE CAN DO

		<string>Oxygen is a very toxic gas and an extreme fire hazard.  It is fatal in
concentrations of as little as 0.000001 p.p.m.  Humans exposed to the
oxygen concentrations die within a few minutes.  Symptoms resemble very
much those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher
concentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it
takes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason
for the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of
oxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex
process called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is
always fatal.

However, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the
fact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is
sufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any
considerable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with
symptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.

Oxygen is an extreme fire hazard.  All of the fires that were reported in
the continental U.S. for the period of the past 25 years were found to be
due to the presence of this gas in the atmosphere surrounding the buildings
in question.

Oxygen is especially dangerous because it is odorless, colorless and
tasteless, so that its presence can not be readily detected until it is
too late.

From which and many other similar phenomena of nature such as the seven
metals, etc., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather that the number
of planets is necessarily seven. [...]

	one and, as a consequence, bringeth much woe unto a purchasing agent.
(6)	Take care that thou tamperest not with interlocks and safety devices,
	for this incurreth the wrath of the chief electrician and bring
	the fury of the engineers on his head.
(7)	Work thou not on energized equipment for if thou doest so, thy
	friends will surely be buying beers for thy widow and consoling
	her in certain ways not generally acceptable to thee.
(8)	Verily, verily I say unto thee, never service equipment alone,
	for electrical cooking is a slow process and thou might sizzle in

		<string>The Man Who Almost Invented The Vacuum Cleaner
	The man officially credited with inventing the vacuum cleaner is
Hubert Cecil Booth.  However, he got the idea from a man who almost
invented it.  
	In 1901 Booth visited a London music-hall.  On the bill was an
American inventor with his wonder machine for removing dust from carpets.
	The machine comprised a box about one foot square with a bag on top.
After watching the act -- which made everyone in the front six rows sneeze
-- Booth went round to the inventor&apos;s dressing room.
	&quot;It should suck not blow,&quot; said Booth, coming straight to the
point.  &quot;Suck?&quot;, exclaimed the enraged inventor.  &quot;Your machine just moves
the dust around the room,&quot; Booth informed him.  &quot;Suck?  Suck?  Sucking is
not possible,&quot; was the inventor&apos;s reply and he stormed out.  Booth proved
that it was by the simple expedient of kneeling down, pursing his lips and
sucking the back of an armchair.  &quot;I almost choked,&quot; he said afterwards.

shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold,
as the light of seven days.&quot;  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much
radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition seven times seven (49) times
as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or fifty times in all.  The light we
receive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the
Sun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature
of Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where
the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,
i.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using
the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute
temperature of the earth (~300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact
temperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the
temperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.
Revelations 21:8 says &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.&quot;  A lake of molten
brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point,
or 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)  We have,
then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.

can opener.
	A month later, returning, the mad scientist went to the engineer&apos;s

pocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an explosive,
and escaped.
	The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids
off the tin cans by throwing them against the wall.  She was developing a good
pitching arm and a new quantum theory.
	The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising

		<string>	While the engineer developed his thesis, the director leaned over to
his assistant and whispered, &quot;Did you ever hear of why the sea is salt?&quot;
	&quot;Why the sea is salt?&quot; whispered back the assistant.  &quot;What do you
mean?&quot;
	The director continued: &quot;When I was a little kid, I heard the story of
`Why the sea is salt&apos; many times, but I never thought it important until just
a moment ago.  It&apos;s something like this: Formerly the sea was fresh water and
salt was rare and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonderful
machine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller
thought himself the most fortunate man in the world, but soon all the villages
had salt to last them for centuries and still the machine kept on grinding
more salt.  The miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his
acres.  At last he determined that he would sink the machine in the sea and
be rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine
were sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that&apos;s
why the sea is salt.&quot;

		<string>A Hen Brooding Kittens
	A friend informs us that he saw at the Novato ranch, Marin county,
a few days since, a hen actually brooding and otherwise caring for three
kittens!  The gentleman upon whose premises this strange event is transpiring
says the hen adopted the kittens when they were but a few days old, and that
she has devoted them her undivided care for several weeks past.  The young
felines are now of respectable size, but they nevertheless follow the hen at
her cluckings, and are regularly brooded at night beneath her wings.

on the Falkland Islands have devised what they consider a marvelous new
game.  Noting that the local penguins are fascinated by airplanes, the
pilots search out a beach where the birds are gathered and fly slowly
along it at the water&apos;s edge.  Perhaps ten thousand penguins turn their
heads in unison watching the planes go by, and when the pilots turn
around and fly back, the birds turn their heads in the opposite
direction, like spectators at a slow-motion tennis match.  Then, the
paper reports &quot;The pilots fly out to sea and directly to the penguin
colony and overfly it.  Heads go up, up, up, and ten thousand penguins
fall over gently onto their backs.

watering hole where the life of the jungle could be observed. As he
looked down from his tree platform and described the scene into his
tape recorder, he saw two gnus grazing peacefully. So preoccupied were
they that they failed to observe the approach of a pride of lions led
by two magnificent specimens, obviously the leaders. The lions charged,
killed the gnus, and dragged them into the bushes where their feasting
could not be seen.  A little while later the two kings of the jungle
emerged and the radioman recorded on his tape: &quot;Well, that&apos;s the end of
the gnus and here, once again, are the head lions.&quot;

around paragraph 16 on the jump (or &quot;Cont.  on ...&quot;) page...

The Post will have a story about Muskie making a speech in Iowa.  The
Star will say the same thing, and the Journal will say nothing at all.
But the Times might have enough room on the jump page to include a line
or so that says something like: &quot;When he finished his speech, Muskie
burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck.

		<string>		Once Again From the Top

Correction notice in the Miami Herald: &quot;Last Sunday, The Herald erroneously
reported that original Dolphin Johnny Holmes had been an insurance salesman
in Raleigh, North Carolina, that he had won the New York lottery in 1982 and
lost the money in a land swindle, that he had been charged with vehicular
homicide, but acquitted because his mother said she drove the car, and that
he stated that the funniest thing he ever saw was Flipper spouting water on
George Wilson.  Each of these items was erroneous material published
inadvertently.  He was not an insurance salesman in Raleigh, did not win the
lottery, neither he nor his mother was charged or involved in any way with
vehicular homicide, and he made no comment about Flipper or George Wilson.
The Herald regrets the errors.&quot;

		<string>ELECTRIC JELL-O

2   boxes JELL-O brand gelatin	2 packages Knox brand unflavored gelatin
2   cups fruit (any variety)	2+ cups water
1/2 bottle Everclear brand grain alcohol

Mix JELL-O and Knox gelatin into 2 cups of boiling water.  Stir &apos;til
	fully dissolved.
Pour hot mixture into a flat pan.  (JELL-O molds won&apos;t work.)
Stir in grain alcohol instead of usual cold water.  Remove any congealing
	glops of slime. (Alcohol has an unusual effect on excess JELL-O.)
Pour in fruit to desired taste, and to absorb any excess alcohol.
Mix in some cold water to dilute the alcohol and make it easier to eat for
	the faint of heart.
Refrigerate overnight to allow mixture to fully harden. (About 8-12 hours.)
Cut into squares and enjoy!

to each other, and sometimes to nobody at all, rearranging your
Christmas-tree ornaments, singing &quot;I Gotta Be Me&quot; around the upright
piano, gulping their drinks and wolfing down hors d&apos;oeuvres.

	Festivity Level 3: Your guests are arguing violently with
inanimate objects, singing &quot;I can&apos;t get no satisfaction,&quot; gulping down
other peoples&apos; drinks, wolfing down Christmas tree ornaments and
placing hors d&apos;oeuvres in the upright piano to see what happens when
the little hammers strike.

	Festivity Level 4: Your guests, hors d&apos;oeuvres smeared all over
their naked bodies are performing a ritual dance around the burning
Christmas tree.  The piano is missing.

	You want to keep your party somewhere around level 3, unless
you rent your home and own Firearms, in which case you can go to level
4.  The best way to get to level 3 is egg-nog.

Tired of finding that other people are helping themselves to your good
liquor at BYOB parties?  Take along a candle, which you insert and
light after you&apos;ve opened the bottle.  No one ever expects anything
drinkable to be in a bottle which has a candle stuck in its neck.

		<string>Glogg (a traditional Scandinavian holiday drink):
	fifth of dry red wine
	fifth of Aquavit
	1 and 1/2 inch piece of cinnamon
	10 cardamom seeds
	1 cup raisins
	4 dried figs
	1 cup blanched or flaked almonds
	a few pieces of dried orange peel
	5 cloves
	1/2 lb. sugar cubes
	Heat up the wine and hard stuff (which may be substituted with wine
for the faint of heart) in a big pot after adding all the other stuff EXCEPT
the sugar cubes.  Just when it reaches boiling, put the sugar in a wire
strainer, moisten it in the hot brew, lift it out and ignite it with a match.
Dip the sugar several times in the liquid until it is all dissolved.  Serve
hot in cups with a few raisins and almonds in each cup.
	N.B. Aquavit may be hard to find and expensive to boot.  Use it only
if you really have a deep-seated desire to be fussy, or if you are of Swedish
extraction.

		<string>In 1967, the Soviet Government minted a beautiful silver ruble with Lenin

		<string>One dusty July afternoon, somewhere around the turn of the century, Patrick
Malone was in Mulcahey&apos;s Bar, bending an elbow with the other street car
conductors from the Brooklyn Traction Company.  While they were discussing the
merits of a local ring hero, the bar goes silent.  Malone turns around to see
his wife, with a face grim as death, stalking to the bar.
	Slapping a four-bit piece down on the bar, she draws herself up to her
full five feet five inches and says to Mulcahey, &quot;Give me what himself has
been havin&apos; all these years.&quot;
	Mulcahey looks at Malone, who shrugs, and then back at Margaret Mary
Malone.  He sets out a glass and pours her a triple shot of Rye.  The bar is
totally silent as they watch the woman pick up the glass and knock back the
drink.  She slams the glass down on the bar, gasps, shudders slightly, and
passes out; falling straight back, stiff as a board, saved from sudden contact
with the barroom floor by the ample belly of Seamus Fogerty.
	Sometime later, she comes to on the pool table, a jacket under her
head.  Her bloodshot eyes fell upon her husband, who says, &quot;And all these
years you&apos;ve been thinkin&apos; I&apos;ve been enjoying meself.&quot;

		<string>A [golf] ball hitting a tree shall be deemed not to have hit the tree.
Hitting a tree is simply bad luck and has no place in a scientific game.
The player should estimate the distance the ball would have traveled if it
had not hit the tree and play the ball from there, preferably atop a nice
firm tuft of grass.
		-- Donald A. Metz

		<string>A [golf] ball sliced or hooked into the rough shall be lifted and placed in
the fairway at a point equal to the distance it carried or rolled into the
rough.  Such veering right or left frequently results from friction between
the face of the club and the cover of the ball and the player should not be
penalized for the erratic behavior of the ball resulting from such
uncontrollable physical phenomena.

		<string>	A boy scout troop went on a hike.  Crossing over a stream, one of
the boys dropped his wallet into the water.  Suddenly a carp jumped, grabbed
the wallet and tossed it to another carp.  Then that carp passed it to
another carp, and all over the river carp appeared and tossed the wallet back
and forth.
	&quot;Well, boys,&quot; said the Scout leader, &quot;you&apos;ve just seen a rare case

		<string>A couple of young fellers were fishing at their special pond off the

one of the boys threw his rod down and started running through the woods
like the proverbial bat out of hell, and hot on his heels ran the Game
Warden.  After about a half mile the fella stopped and stooped over with
his hands on his thighs, whooping and heaving to catch his breath as the
Game Warden finally caught up to him.
	&quot;Let&apos;s see yer fishin&apos; license, boy,&quot; the Warden gasped.  The
man pulled out his wallet and gave the Game Warden a valid fishing
license.
	&quot;Well, son&quot;, snarled the Game Warden, &quot;You must be about as dumb
as a box of rocks!  You didn&apos;t have to run if you have a license!&quot;

discovered that all his lines were hopelessly tangled.  At about 5,000 feet,

same speed as he was going towards the ground.  As they passed each other at
3,000 feet, the &apos;chutist yells, &quot;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&quot;

	Instead of answering, the hunter showed the ranger his game bag,
which contained twelve more loons.
	&quot;Why would you shoot loons?&quot;, the ranger asked.
	&quot;Well, my family eats them and I sell the plumage.&quot;

		<string>Although written many years ago, Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover has just been

pheasant-raising, the apprehending of poachers, ways to control vermin,
and other chores and duties of the professional gamekeeper.

		<string>Brandy Davis, an outfielder and teammate of mine with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
is my choice for team captain.  Cincinnatti was beating us 3-1, and I led
off the bottom of the eighth with a walk.  The next hitter banged a hard

kept going, sliding safely into third base.
	With runners at first and third, and home-run hitter Ralph Kiner at
bat, our manager put in the fast Brandy Davis to run for the player at first.
Even with Kiner hitting and a change to win the game with a home run, Brandy
took off for second and made it.  Now we had runners at second and third.
	I&apos;m standing at third, knowing I&apos;m not going anywhere, and see Brandy
start to take a lead.  All of a sudden, here he comes.  He makes a great slide

		<string>	COONDOG MEMORY
	(heard in Rutledge, Missouri, about eighteen years ago)

Now, this dog is for sale, and she can not only follow a trail twice as
old as the average dog can, but she&apos;s got a pretty good memory to boot.
For instance, last week this old boy who lives down the road from me, and
is forever stinkmouthing my hounds, brought some city fellow around to
try out ol&apos; Sis here.  So I turned her out south of the house and she made
two or three big swings back and forth across the edge of the woods, set
back her head, bayed a couple of times, cut straight through the woods,
come to a little clearing, jumped about three foot straight up in the air,
run to the other side, and commenced to letting out a racket like she had
something treed.  We went over there with our flashlights and shone them
up in the tree but couldn&apos;t catch no shine offa coon&apos;s eyes, and my
neighbor sorta indicated that ol&apos; Sis might be a little crazy, `cause she
stood right to the tree and kept singing up into it.  So I pulled off my
coat and climbed up into the branches, and sure enough, there was a coon
skeleton wedged in between a couple of branches about twenty foot up.
Now as I was saying, she can follow a pretty old trail, but this fellow
was still calling her crazy or touched `cause she had hopped up in the
air while she was crossing the clearing, until I reminded him that the
Hawkins&apos; had a fence across there about five years back.  Now, this dog
is for sale.

Quarterback:
	Sophomore Dave Strewzinski... likes to pass.  And pass he does, with
a record 86 attempts (three completions) in 87 plays....  Though Strewzinksi
has so far failed to score any points for the Crimson, his jackrabbit speed
has made him the least sacked quarterback in the Ivy league.
Wide Receiver:
	The other directional signal in Harvard&apos;s offensive machine is senior
Phil Yip, who is very fast.  Yip is so fast that he has set a record for being
fast.  Expect to see Yip elude all pursuers and make it into the endzone five
or six times, his average for a game.  Yip, nicknamed &quot;fumblefingers&quot; and &quot;you

	(2) Never precede any maneuver by a comment more predictive
	   than &quot;Watch this!&quot;
	(3) The probability of a Frisbee hitting something is directly
	   proportional to the cost of hitting it.  For instance, a
	   Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman or
	   a little old lady rather than the beat up Chevy.
	(4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the
	   cute girl you&apos;ve been trying to impress is watching, the
	   Frisbee will invariably bounce out of your hand or hit you
	   in the head and knock you silly.

		<string>&quot;Oh, he [a big dog] hunts with papa,&quot; she said. &quot;He says Don Carlos [the

and did real well at it.  Then Papa bought some ducks, not wild ducks but,
you know, farm ducks.  And it got Don Carlos all mixed up.  Since the
ducks were always around the yard with nobody shooting at them he knew he
wasn&apos;t supposed to kill them, but he had to do something.  So one morning
last spring, when the ground was still soft, he took all the ducks and
buried them.&quot;  &quot;What do you mean, buried them?&quot;  &quot;Oh, he didn&apos;t hurt them.
He dug little holes all over the yard and picked up the ducks in his mouth
and put them in the holes.  Then he covered them up with mud except for
their heads.  He did thirteen ducks that way and was digging a hole for
another one when Tony found him.  We talked about it for a long time.  Papa
said Don Carlos was afraid the ducks might run away, and since he didn&apos;t
know how to build a cage he put them in holes.  He&apos;s a smart dog.&quot;

to remind himself that the basses usually required an extra cue towards the
end of the symphony, the conductor would fasten a piece of string around the
page of the score before the bass cue.  As the basses grew more and more
inebriated, two of them fell asleep.  The conductor grew quite nervous (he
was very concerned about the pitch) because it was the bottom of the ninth;

good baseball player, better than I am, anyway, but there&apos;s no way to know
for sure because if the ball gets anywhere near her, a male comes barging
over from, say, right field, to deal with it.  She&apos;s been on the team for
three seasons now, but the males still don&apos;t trust her.  They know, deep in
their souls, that if she had to choose between catching a fly ball and saving
an infant&apos;s life, she probably would elect to save the infant&apos;s life, without
ever considering whether there were men on base.

		<string>Several years ago, an international chess tournament was being held in a
swank hotel in New York.  Most of the major stars of the chess world were
there, and after a grueling day of chess, the players and their entourages
retired to the lobby of the hotel for a little refreshment.  In the lobby,
some players got into a heated argument about who was the brightest, the
fastest, and the best chess player in the world.  The argument got quite
loud, as various players claimed that honor.  At that point, a security
guard in the lobby turned to another guard and commented, &quot;If there&apos;s
anything I just can&apos;t stand, it&apos;s chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.&quot;

		<string>The Fastest Defeat In Chess
	The big name for us in the world of chess is Gibaud, a French chess
master.  
	In Paris during 1924 he was beaten after only four moves by a
Monsieur Lazard.  Happily for posterity, the moves are recorded and so
chess enthusiasts may reconstruct this magnificent collapse in the comfort
of their own homes.
	Lazard was black and Gibaud white:
	1: P-Q4, Kt-KB3
	2: Kt-Q2, P-K4
	3: PxP, Kt-Kt5
	4: P-K6, Kt-K6
	White then resigns on realizing that a fifth move would involve
either a Q-KR5 check or the loss of his queen.

		<string>Falling in Love
	When two people have been on enough dates, they generally fall in
love.  You can tell you&apos;re in love by the way you feel: your head becomes
light, your heart leaps within you, you feel like you&apos;re walking on air,
and the whole world seems like a wonderful and happy place.  Unfortunately,
these are also the four warning signs of colon disease, so it&apos;s always a
good idea to check with your doctor.

		<string>Falling in love is a lot like dying.  You never get to do it enough to

		<string>Speaking of love, one problem that recurs more and more frequently these
days, in books and plays and movies, is the inability of people to communicate
with the people they love; Husbands and wives who can&apos;t communicate, children
who can&apos;t communicate with their parents, and so on.  And the characters in
these books and plays and so on (and in real life, I might add) spend hours
bemoaning the fact that they can&apos;t communicate.  I feel that if a person can&apos;t
communicate, the very _____least he can do is to shut up!

		<string>	The birds are singing, the flowers are budding, and it is time
for Miss Manners to tell young lovers to stop necking in public.
	It&apos;s not that Miss Manners is immune to romance.  Miss Manners
has been known to squeeze a gentleman&apos;s arm while being helped over a
curb, and, in her wild youth, even to press a dainty slipper against a
foot or two under the dinner table.  Miss Manners also believes that the
sight of people strolling hand in hand or arm in arm or arm in hand
dresses up a city considerably more than the more familiar sight of
people shaking umbrellas at one another.  What Miss Manners objects to
is the kind of activity that frightens the horses on the street...

watching TV cartoon shows in the morning, and they&apos;ll show a commercial for
a children&apos;s compressed breakfast compound such as &quot;Froot Loops&quot; or &quot;Lucky
Charms&quot;, and they always show it sitting on a table next to some actual food
such as eggs, and the announcer always says: &quot;Part of this complete
breakfast&quot;.  Don&apos;t that really mean, &quot;Adjacent to this complete breakfast&quot;,
or &quot;On the same table as this complete breakfast&quot;?  And couldn&apos;t they make
essentially the same claim if, instead of Froot Loops, they put a can of
shaving cream there, or a dead bat?

		<string>For those of you who have been unfortunate enough to never have tasted the
&apos;Great Chieftain O&apos; the Pudden Race&apos; (i.e. haggis) here is an easy to follow
recipe which results in a dish remarkably similar to the above mentioned
protected species.
	Ingredients:
	  1 Sheep&apos;s Pluck (heart, lungs, liver) and bag
	  2 teacupsful toasted oatmeal
	  1 teaspoonful salt
	  8 oz. shredded suet
	  2 small onions
	1/2 teaspoonful black pepper
    
	Scrape and clean bag in cold, then warm, water.  Soak in salt water
overnight.  Wash pluck, then boil for 2 hours with windpipe draining over
the side of pot.  Retain 1 pint of stock.  Cut off windpipe, remove surplus
gristle, chop or mince heart and lungs, and grate best part of liver (about
half only).  Parboil and chop onions, mix all together with oatmeal, suet,
salt, pepper and stock to moisten.  Pack the mixture into bag, allowing for
swelling.  Boil for three hours, pricking regularly all over.  If bag not
available, steam in greased basin covered by greaseproof paper and cloth for
four to five hours.

3:  Carob is not an acceptable substitute for chocolate.  In fact, carob is not
    an acceptable substitute for anything, except, perhaps, brown shoe polish.
4:  There is no such thing as a &quot;fun salad.&quot;  So let&apos;s stop pretending and see
    salads for what they are:  God&apos;s punishment for being fat.
5:  Fruit salad without maraschino cherries and marshmallows is about as
    appealing as tepid beer.
6:  A world lacking gravy is a tragic place!
7:  You should immediately pass up any recipes entitled &quot;luscious and
    low-cal.&quot;  Also skip dishes featuring &quot;lively liver.&quot;  They aren&apos;t and
    it isn&apos;t.
8:  Wearing a blindfold often makes many diet foods more palatable.
9:  Fresh fruit is not dessert.  CAKE is dessert!
10: Okra tastes slightly worse than its name implies.
11: A plain baked potato isn&apos;t worth the effort involved in chewing and

		<string>Just a few of the perfect excuses for having some strawberry shortcake.
Pick one.

	 (1)	It&apos;s less calories than two pieces of strawberry shortcake.
	 (2)	It&apos;s cheaper than going to France.
	 (3)	It neutralizes the brownies I had yesterday.
	 (4)	Life is short.
	 (5)	It&apos;s somebody&apos;s birthday.  I don&apos;t want them to celebrate alone.
	 (6)	It matches my eyes.
	 (7)	Whoever said, &quot;Let them eat cake.&quot; must have been talking to me.
	 (8)	To punish myself for eating dessert yesterday.
	 (9)	Compensation for all the time I spend in the shower not eating.
	(10)	Strawberry shortcake is evil.  I must help rid the world of it.
	(11)	I&apos;m getting weak from eating all that healthy stuff.
	(12)	It&apos;s the second anniversary of the night I ate plain broccoli.

		<string>Lobster:
	Everyone loves these delectable crustaceans, but many cooks are
squeamish about placing them into boiling water alive, which is the only
proper method of preparing them.  Frankly, the easiest way to eliminate your
guilt is to establish theirs by putting them on trial before they&apos;re cooked.
The fact is, lobsters are among the most ferocious predators on the sea
floor, and you&apos;re helping reduce crime in the reefs.  Grasp the lobster
behind the head, look it right in its unmistakably guilty eyestalks and say,
&quot;Where were you on the night of the 21st?&quot;, then flourish a picture of a
scallop or a sole and shout, &quot;Perhaps this will refresh that crude neural
apparatus you call a memory!&quot;  The lobster will squirm noticeably.  It may
even take a swipe at you with one of its claws.  Incorrigible.  Pop it into
the pot.  Justice has been served, and shortly you and your friends will
be, too.

		<string>MOCK APPLE PIE (No Apples Needed)

  Pastry to two crust 9-inch pie	36 RITZ Crackers
2 cups water				 2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons cream of tartar		 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  Grated rind of one lemon		   Butter or margarine
  Cinnamon

Roll out bottom crust of pastry and fit into 9-inch pie plate.  Break
RITZ Crackers coarsely into pastry-lined plate.  Combine water, sugar
and cream of tartar in saucepan, boil gently for 15 minutes.  Add lemon
juice and rind.  Cool.  Pour this syrup over Crackers, dot generously
with butter or margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Cover with top
crust.  Trim and flute edges together.  Cut slits in top crust to let
steam escape.  Bake in a hot oven (425 F) 30 to 35 minutes, until crust
is crisp and golden.  Serve warm.  Cut into 6 to 8 slices.

time some housewife or boutique-owner-turned-diet-expert appears on TV
to plug her latest book.  And, if you still feel a twinge of guilt for
eating coffee cake while listening to her exhortations, ask yourself
the following questions:

	(1) Do I dare trust a person who actually considers alfalfa sprouts a
	    food?
	(2) Was the author&apos;s sole motive in writing this book to get rich
	    exploiting the forlorn hopes of chubby people like me?
	(3) Would a longer life be worthwhile if it had to be lived as
	    prescribed ... without French-fried onion rings, pizza with
	    double cheese, or the occasional Mai-Tai?  (Remember, living
	    right doesn&apos;t really make you live longer, it just *seems* like
	    longer.)

That, and another piece of coffee cake, should do the trick.

		<string>RULES OF EATING -- THE BRONX DIETER&apos;S CREED
	(1)  Never eat on an empty stomach.
	(2)  Never leave the table hungry.
	(3)  When traveling, never leave a country hungry.
	(4)  Enjoy your food.
	(5)  Enjoy your companion&apos;s food.
	(6)  Really taste your food.  It may take several portions to
	     accomplish this, especially if subtly seasoned.
	(7)  Really feel your food.  Texture is important.  Compare,
	     for example, the texture of a turnip to that of a
	     brownie.  Which feels better against your cheeks?
	(8)  Never eat between snacks, unless it&apos;s a meal.
	(9)  Don&apos;t feel you must finish everything on your plate.  You
	     can always eat it later.
	(10) Avoid any wine with a childproof cap.
	(11) Avoid blue food.

the wineyness of a late sun, the intimate kiss of fertilizing rain, and the

out immediately, because they know it is not an excellent restaurant.  If
it were, it would have an enormous crowd of excellence-oriented people

</string>
		<string>It&apos;s all in the mind, ya know.
</string>
		<string>It&apos;s lucky you&apos;re going so slowly, because you&apos;re going in the wrong direction.

have a lucky day this year.
</string>
		<string>Of course you have a purpose -- to find a purpose.
</string>
		<string>People are beginning to notice you.  Try dressing before you leave the house.

		<string>A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength.  It has been universally
established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon
or three normal sized billiard balls.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>&quot;A wizard cannot do everything; a fact most magicians are reticent to admit,
let alone discuss with prospective clients.  Still, the fact remains that 
there are certain objects, and people, that are, for one reason or another, 
completely immune to any direct magical spell.  It is for this group of
beings that the magician learns the subtleties of using indirect spells.
It also does no harm, in dealing with these matters, to carry a large club
near your person at all times.&quot;
		-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VIII
</string>
		<string>An ancient proverb summed it up: when a wizard is tired of looking for
broken glass in his dinner, it ran, he is tired of life.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>Chaos is King and Magic is loose in the world.
</string>
		<string>Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they become soggy and hard to
light.
</string>
		<string>Do not throw cigarette butts in the urinal, for they are subtle and
quick to anger.
</string>
		<string>&quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for you are crunchy and good
with ketchup.&quot;
</string>
		<string>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
		-- Aleister Crowley
</string>
		<string>Eight was also the Number of Bel-Shamharoth, which was why a sensible wizard
would never mention the number if he could avoid it.  Or you&apos;ll be eight
alive, apprentices were jocularly warned.  Bel-Shamharoth was especially
attracted to dabblers in magic who, by being as it were beachcombers on the
shores of the unnatural, were already half-enmeshed in his nets.
Rincewind&apos;s room number in his hall of residence had been 7a.  He hadn&apos;t
been surprised.

		<string>&quot;How do you know she is a unicorn?&quot; Molly demanded.  &quot;And why were you afraid
to let her touch you?  I saw you.  You were afraid of her.&quot;
	&quot;I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,&quot; the cat
replied without rancor.  &quot;I would not waste time in foolishness if I were 
you.  As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be
deceived by appearances.  Unlike human beings, who enjoy them.  As for your
second question --&quot;  Here he faltered, and suddenly became very interested
in washing; nor would he speak until he had licked himself fluffy and then
licked himself smooth again.  Even then he would not look at Molly, but 
examined his claws.
	&quot;If she had touched me,&quot; he said very softly, &quot;I would have been
hers and not my own, not ever again.&quot;
		-- Peter S. Beagle, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;
</string>
		<string>It is a well known fact that warriors and wizards do not get along, because
one side considers the other side to be a collection of bloodthirsty idiots
who can&apos;t walk and think at the same time, while the other side is naturally
suspicious of a body of men who mumble a lot and wear long dresses.  Oh, say
the wizards, if we&apos;re going to be like that, then, what about all those
studded collars and oiled muscles down at the Young Men&apos;s Pagan Association?
To which the heroes reply, that&apos;s a pretty good allegation from a bunch of
wimpsoes who won&apos;t go near a woman on account, can you believe it, of their
mystical power being sort of drained out.  Right, say the wizards, that just
about does it, you and your leather posing pouches.  Oh yeah, say the the
heroes, why don&apos;t you ...

		<string>It is well known that *things* from undesirable universes are always seeking

		<string>	It seems there&apos;s this magician working one of the luxury cruise ships
for a few years.  He doesn&apos;t have to change his routines much as the audiences
change over fairly often, and he&apos;s got a good life.   The only problem is the
ship&apos;s parrot, who perches in the hall and watches him night after night, year
after year.  Finally, the parrot figures out how almost every trick works and
starts giving it away for the audience.  For example, when the magician makes
a bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squawks &quot;Behind his back!  Behind
his back!&quot;  Well, the magician is really annoyed at this, but there&apos;s not much
he can do about it as the parrot is a ship&apos;s mascot and very popular with the
passengers.
	One night, the ship strikes some floating debris, and sinks without
a trace.  Almost everyone aboard was lost, except for the magician and the
parrot.  For three days and nights they just drift, with the magician clinging
to one end of a piece of driftwood and the parrot perched on the other end.
As the sun rises on the morning of the fourth day, the parrot walks over to
the magician&apos;s end of the log.  With obvious disgust in his voice, he snaps
&quot;OK, you win, I give up.  Where did you hide the ship?&quot;
</string>
		<string>Knowledge is power -- knowledge shared is power lost.
		-- Aleister Crowley
</string>
		<string>Magic is always the best solution -- especially reliable magic.
</string>
		<string>No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife in the shoulder blades will seriously
cramp his style.
</string>
		<string>Rincewind had generally been considered by his tutors to be a natural wizard
in the same way that fish are natural mountaineers.  He probably would have
been thrown out of Unseen University anyway--he couldn&apos;t remember spells and
smoking made him feel ill.
		-- Terry Pratchett, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;
</string>
		<string>Somewhere, just out of sight, the unicorns are gathering.
</string>
		<string>The default Magic Word, &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, actually is a corruption of the
Hebrew phrase &quot;ha-Bracha dab&apos;ra&quot; which means &quot;pronounce the blessing&quot;.
</string>
		<string>&quot;The first rule of magic is simple.  Don&apos;t waste your time waving your
hands and hoping when a rock or a club will do.&quot;
		-- McCloctnik the Lucid
</string>
		<string>	The seven eyes of Ningauble the Wizard floated back to his hood as he
reported to Fafhrd: &quot;I have seen much, yet cannot explain all.  The Gray
Mouser is exactly twenty-five feet below the deepest cellar in the palace
of Gilpkerio Kistomerces.  Even though twenty-four parts in twenty-five of
him are dead, he is alive.
	&quot;Now about Lankhmar.  She&apos;s been invaded, her walls breached
everywhere and desperate fighting is going on in the streets, by a fierce
host which out-numbers Lankhamar&apos;s inhabitants by fifty to one -- and
equipped with all modern weapons.  Yet you can save the city.&quot;
	&quot;How?&quot; demanded Fafhrd.
	Ningauble shrugged.  &quot;You&apos;re a hero.  You should know.&quot;
		-- Fritz Leiber, &quot;The Swords of Lankhmar&quot;
</string>
		<string>	&quot;Then what is magic for?&quot; Prince Lir demanded wildly.  &quot;What use is
wizardry if it cannot save a unicorn?&quot;  He gripped the magician&apos;s shoulder
hard, to keep from falling.
	Schmendrick did not turn his head.  With a touch of sad mockery in
his voice, he said, &quot;That&apos;s what heroes are for.&quot;
...
	&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; he [Prince Lir] said.  &quot;That is exactly what heroes
are for.  Wizards make no difference, so they say that nothing does, but
heroes are meant to die for unicorns.&quot;
		-- Peter Beagle, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;
</string>
		<string>There are those who claim that magic is like the tide; that it swells and
fades over the surface of the earth, collecting in concentrated pools here
and there, almost disappearing from other spots, leaving them parched for
wonder.  There are also those who believe that if you stick your fingers up
your nose and blow, it will increase your intelligence.
		-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VII
</string>
		<string>Unseen University had never admitted women, muttering something about
problems with the plumbing, but the real reason was an unspoken dread that
if women were allowed to mess around with magic they would probably be
embarrassingly good at it ...

</string>
		<string>	&quot;Verily and forsooth,&quot; replied Goodgulf darkly.  &quot;In the past year
strange and fearful wonders I have seen.  Fields sown with barley reap
crabgrass and fungus, and even small gardens reject their artichoke hearts.
There has been a hot day in December and a blue moon.  Calendars are made with
a month of Sundays and a blue-ribbon Holstein bore alive two insurance
salesmen.  The earth splits and the entrails of a goat were found tied in
square knots.  The face of the sun blackens and the skies have rained down
soggy potato chips.&quot;
	&quot;But what do all these things mean?&quot; gasped Frito.
	&quot;Beats me,&quot; said Goodgulf with a shrug, &quot;but I thought it made good
copy.&quot;
		-- Harvard Lampoon, &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;
</string>
		<string>Watch Rincewind.

Look at him.  Scrawny, like most wizards, and clad in a dark red robe on
which a few mystic sigils were embroidered in tarnished sequins. Some might
have taken him for a mere apprentice enchanter who had run away from his
master out of defiance, boredom, fear and a lingering taste for
heterosexuality.  Yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon
that marked him as an alumnus of Unseen University, the high school of magic
whose time-and-space transcendent campus is never precisely Here or There.
Graduates were usually destined for mageship at least, but Rincewind--after
an unfortunate event--had left knowing only one spell and made a living of
sorts around the town by capitalizing on an innate gift for languages.  He
avoided work as a rule, but had a quickness of wit that put his
acquaintances in mind of a bright rodent.

		<string>A cow is a completely automated milk-manufacturing machine. It is encased
in untanned leather and mounted on four vertical, movable supports, one at
each corner.  The front end of the machine, or input, contains the cutting
and grinding mechanism, utilizing a unique feedback device.  Here also are
the headlights, air inlet and exhaust, a bumper and a foghorn.
	At the rear, the machine carries the milk-dispensing equipment as
well as a built-in flyswatter and insect repeller.  The central portion
houses a hydro- chemical-conversion unit.  Briefly, this consists of four
fermentation and storage tanks connected in series by an intricate network
of flexible plumbing.  This assembly also contains the central heating plant
complete with automatic temperature controls, pumping station and main
ventilating system.  The waste disposal apparatus is located to the rear of
this central section.
	Cows are available fully-assembled in an assortment of sizes and
colors.  Production output ranges from 2 to 20 tons of milk per year.  In
brief, the main external visible features of the cow are:  two lookers, two
hookers, four stander-uppers, four hanger-downers, and a swishy-wishy.

		<string>A feed salesman is on his way to a farm.  As he&apos;s driving along at forty

m.p.h.  The chicken keeps right up with him the whole way, then suddenly
takes off and disappears into the distance.

		<string>A traveling salesman was driving past a farm when he saw a pig with three

Intrigued, he drove up to the farmhouse, where he found an old farmer
sitting in the yard watching the pig.  
	&quot;That&apos;s quite a pig you have there, sir&quot; said the salesman. 
	&quot;Sure is, son,&quot; the farmer replied.  &quot;Why, two years ago, my daughter
was swimming in the lake and bumped her head and damned near drowned, but that
pig swam out and dragged her back to shore.&quot;

		<string>Between 1950 and 1952, a bored weatherman, stationed north of Hudson
Bay, left a monument that neither government nor time can eradicate.
Using a bulldozer abandoned by the Air Force, he spent two years and
great effort pushing boulders into a single word.

It can be seen from 10,000 feet, silhouetted against the snow.
Government officials exchanged memos full of circumlocutions (no Latin
equivalent exists) but failed to word an appropriation bill for the
destruction of this cairn, that wouldn&apos;t alert the press and embarrass
both Parliament and Party.

It stands today, a monument to human spirit.  If life exists on other
planets, this may be the first message received from us.

		<string>But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who was a
brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal education and
lived in New Jersey.  Edison&apos;s first major invention in 1877, was the
phonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of American homes, where
it basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented.  But Edison&apos;s
greatest achievement came in 1879, when he invented the electric company.
Edison&apos;s design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple electrical circuit:
the electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, then
immediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this is
the brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of
electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few
customers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact the
last year any new electricity was generated in the United States was 1937;
the electric companies have been merely re-selling it ever since, which is
why they have so much free time to apply for rate increases.

		<string>	By the middle 1880&apos;s, practically all the roads except those in
the South, were of the present standard gauge.  The southern roads were
still five feet between rails.
	It was decided to change the gauge of all southern roads to standard,
in one day.  This remarkable piece of work was carried out on a Sunday in May
of 1886.  For weeks beforehand, shops had been busy pressing wheels in on the
axles to the new and narrower gauge, to have a supply of rolling stock which
could run on the new track as soon as it was ready.  Finally, on the day set,
great numbers of gangs of track layers went to work at dawn.  Everywhere one
rail was loosened, moved in three and one-half inches, and spiked down in its
new position.  By dark, trains from anywhere in the United States could operate
over the tracks in the South, and a free interchange of freight cars everywhere
was possible.

		<string>Dear Mister Language Person: What is the purpose of the apostrophe?

Answer: The apostrophe is used mainly in hand-lettered small business signs
to alert the reader than an &quot;S&quot; is coming up at the end of a word, as in:
WE DO NOT EXCEPT PERSONAL CHECK&apos;S, or: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ITEM&apos;S.
Another important grammar concept to bear in mind when creating hand- lettered
small-business signs is that you should put quotation marks around random
words for decoration, as in &quot;TRY&quot; OUR HOT DOG&apos;S, or even TRY &quot;OUR&quot; HOT DOG&apos;S.

otherwise the plan was off.  Sam&apos;s boss and his fellow workers pleaded
and cajoled, but to no avail.  Sam said the plan would never pay off.
Finally the company president called Sam into his office.
	&quot;Sam,&quot; he said, &quot;here&apos;s a copy of the new pension plan and here&apos;s

		<string>	Home centers are designed for the do-it-yourselfer who&apos;s willing to
pay higher prices for the convenience of being able to shop for lumber,
hardware, and toasters all in one location.  Notice I say &quot;shop for,&quot; as
opposed to &quot;obtain.&quot; This is the major drawback of home centers: they are
always out of everything except artificial Christmas trees.  The home center
employees have no time to reorder merchandise because they are too busy
applying little price stickers to every object -- every board, washer, nail
and screw -- in the entire store ...

	Let&apos;s say a piece in your toilet tank breaks, so you remove the
broken part, take it to the home center, and ask an employee if he has a
replacement.  The employee, who has never is his life even seen the inside
of a toilet tank, will peer at the broken part in very much the same way
that a member of a primitive Amazon jungle tribe would look at an electronic
calculator, and then say, &quot;We&apos;re expecting a shipment of these sometime
around the middle of next week.&quot;

around your home are too difficult to tackle.  So, when your furnace
explodes, you call in a so-called professional to fix it.  The
&quot;professional&quot; arrives in a truck with lettering on the sides and deposits a
large quantity of tools and two assistants who spend the better part of the
week in your basement whacking objects at random with heavy wrenches, after
which the &quot;professional&quot; returns and gives you a bill for slightly more
money than it would cost you to run a successful campaign for the U.S.
Senate.
	And that&apos;s why you&apos;ve decided to start doing things yourself. You
figure, &quot;If those guys can fix my furnace, then so can I.  How difficult can
it be?&quot;
	Very difficult.  In fact, most home projects are impossible, which
is why you should do them yourself.  There is no point in paying other
people to screw things up when you can easily screw them up yourself for far
less money.  This article can help you.

Reply:		Mice have four feet.
M:	Elaborate!
R:	Mice have five appendages, and four of them are feet.
M:	No discussion of fifth appendage!
R:	Mice have five appendages; four of them are feet; one is a tail.
M:	What?  Feet with no legs?
R:	Mice have four legs, four feet, and one tail per unit-mouse.
M:	Confusing -- is that a total of 9 appendages?
R:	Mice have four leg-foot assemblies and one tail assembly per body.
M:	Does not fully discuss the issue!
R:	Each mouse comes equipped with four legs and a tail.  Each leg
	is equipped with a foot at the end opposite the body; the tail
	is not equipped with a foot.
M:	Descriptive?  Yes.  Forceful NO!
R:	Allotment of appendages for mice will be:  Four foot-leg assemblies,
	one tail.  Deviation from this policy is not permitted as it would
	constitute misapportionment of scarce appendage assets.
M:	Too authoritarian; stifles creativity!
R:	Mice have four feet; each foot is attached to a small leg joined
	integrally with the overall mouse structural sub-system.  Also
	attached to the mouse sub-system is a thin tail, non-functional and

		<string>	NEW YORK-- Kraft Foods, Inc. announced today that its board of
directors unanimously rejected the $11 billion takeover bid by Philip
Morris and Co. A Kraft spokesman stated in a press conference that the
offer was rejected because the $90-per-share bid did not reflect the
true value of the company.
	Wall Street insiders, however, tell quite a different story.
Apparently, the Kraft board of directors had all but signed the takeover
agreement when they learned of Philip Morris&apos; marketing plans for one of
their major Middle East subsidiaries.  To a person, the board voted to
reject the bid when they discovered that the tobacco giant intended to
reorganize Israeli Cheddar, Ltd., and name the new company Cheeses of Nazareth.

		<string>None of our men are &quot;experts.&quot;  We have most unfortunately found it necessary
to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert -- because no one 
ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job.  A man who knows a 
job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing 
forward and never gives up an instant of thought to how good and how efficient 
he is.  Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a

		<string>	Now, you might ask, &quot;How do I get one of those complete home tool
sets for under $4?&quot; An excellent question.
	Go to one of those really cheap discount stores where they sell
plastic furniture in colors visible from the planet Neptune and where they
have a food section specializing in cardboard cartons full of Raisinets and
malted milk balls manufactured during the Nixon administration.  In either
the hardware or housewares department, you&apos;ll find an item imported from an
obscure Oriental country and described as &quot;Nine Tools in One&quot;, consisting of
a little handle with interchangeable ends representing inscrutable Oriental
notions of tools that Americans might use around the home.  Buy it.
	This is the kind of tool set professionals use.  Not only is it
inexpensive, but it also has a great safety feature not found in the
so-called quality tools sets: The handle will actually break right off if
you accidentally hit yourself or anything else, or expose it to direct
sunlight.

and drove off along the route.  No problems for the first few stops -- a few
people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.  At the next
stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on.  Six feet eight, built like a
wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground.  He glared at the driver and said,
&quot;Big John doesn&apos;t pay!&quot; and sat down at the back.
	Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically
meek?  Well, he was.  Naturally, he didn&apos;t argue with Big John, but he wasn&apos;t
happy about it.  Well, the next day the same thing happened -- Big John got on
again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down.  And the next day, and the
one after that, and so forth.  This grated on the bus driver, who started
losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.  Finally he
could stand it no longer. He signed up for bodybuilding courses, karate, judo,
and all that good stuff.  By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong;
what&apos;s more, he felt really good about himself.
	So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus
and said &quot;Big John doesn&apos;t pay!,&quot; the driver stood up, glared back at the
passenger, and screamed, &quot;And why not?&quot;
	With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, &quot;Big John has a
bus pass.&quot;

laughed.  &quot;You will not succeed,&quot; they told him.  &quot;No one can.&quot;

happen in that time.  The king might die.  The horse might die.  I might die.

		<string>One possible reason that things aren&apos;t going according to plan
is that there never was a plan in the first place.
</string>
		<string>One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could
manufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they be
installed on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let&apos;s say your
congressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on how
the French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when he
got to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, would
inflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through the
plane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman
proposed a law.  (&quot;Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October be
designated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.&quot;)
This would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public
would violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.  The problem
is that your potential market is very small: there are only around 500
members of Congress, and some of them, such as House Speaker &quot;Tip&quot; O&apos;Neil,
are already too large to fit on normal aircraft.

requiring only a few simple tools and a willingness to stick your arm into a
clogged toilet.  In fact, you can solve many home plumbing problems, such as
annoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the radio.  But before we get
into specific techniques, let&apos;s look at how plumbing works.
	A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system, except
that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires, it has
pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets and toilets.
So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at all like your
electrical system, which is good, because electricity can kill you.

		<string>Several years ago, some smart businessmen had an idea: Why not build a big
store where a do-it-yourselfer could get everything he needed at reasonable

center.  And before long home centers were springing up like crabgrass all
over the United States.

		<string>	Take the folks at Coca-Cola.  For many years, they were content
to sit back and make the same old carbonated beverage.  It was a good
beverage, no question about it; generations of people had grown up
drinking it and doing the experiment in sixth grade where you put a
nail into a glass of Coke and after a couple of days the nail dissolves
and the teacher says: &quot;Imagine what it does to your TEETH!&quot;  So Coca-Cola
was solidly entrenched in the market, and the management saw no need to
improve ...

		<string>The annual meeting of the &quot;You Have To Listen To Experience&quot; Club is now in
session.  Our Achievement Awards this year are in the fields of publishing,
advertising and industry.  For best consistent contribution in the field of
publishing our award goes to editor, R.L.K., [...] for his unrivalled alle-
giance without variation to the statement: &quot;Personally I&apos;d love to do it,
we&apos;d ALL love to do it.  But we&apos;re not going to do it.  It&apos;s not the kind of
book our house knows how to handle.&quot;  Our superior performance award in the
field of advertising goes to media executive, E.L.M., [...] for the continu-
ally creative use of the old favorite: &quot;I think what you&apos;ve got here could be
very exciting.  Why not give it one more try based on the approach I&apos;ve out-
lined and see if you can come up with something fresh.&quot;  Our final award for
courageous holding action in the field of industry goes to supervisor, R.S.,
[...] for her unyielding grip on &quot;I don&apos;t care if they fire me, I&apos;ve been
arguing for a new approach for YEARS but are we SURE that this is the right
time--&quot;  I would like to conclude this meeting with a verse written specially
for our prospectus by our founding president fifty years ago -- and now, as
then, fully expressive of the emotion most close to all our hearts --
	Treat freshness as a youthful quirk,
		And dare not stray to ideas new,
	For if t&apos;were tried they might e&apos;en work
		And for a living what woulds&apos;t we do?

		<string>	The boss returned from lunch in a good mood and called the whole staff
in to listen to a couple of jokes he had picked up.  Everybody but one girl
laughed uproariously.  &quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; grumbled the boss. &quot;Haven&apos;t you

		<string>The departing division general manager met a last time with his young
successor and gave him three envelopes.  &quot;My predecessor did this for me,
and I&apos;ll pass the tradition along to you,&quot; he said.  &quot;At the first sign
of trouble, open the first envelope.  Any further difficulties, open the
second envelope.  Then, if problems continue, open the third envelope.
Good luck.&quot;  The new manager returned to his office and tossed the envelopes
into a drawer.
	Six months later, costs soared and earnings plummeted. Shaken, the
young man opened the first envelope, which said, &quot;Blame it all on me.&quot;
	The next day, he held a press conference and did just that.  The
crisis passed.
	Six months later, sales dropped precipitously.  The beleagured
manager opened the second envelope.  It said, &quot;Reorganize.&quot;
	He held another press conference, announcing that the division
would be restructured.  The crisis passed.
	A year later, everything went wrong at once and the manager was
blamed for all of it.  The harried executive closed his office door, sank
into his chair, and opened the third envelope.
	&quot;Prepare three envelopes...&quot; it said.

their lives trying to have the old ones repaired at so-called &quot;factory

		<string>The Worst Car Hire Service
	When David Schwartz left university in 1972, he set up Rent-a-wreck
as a joke.  Being a natural prankster, he acquired a fleet of beat-up
shabby, wreckages waiting for the scrap heap in California.
	He put on a cap and looked forward to watching people&apos;s faces as he
conducted them round the choice of bumperless, dented junkmobiles.
	To his lasting surprise there was an insatiable demand for them and
he now has 26 thriving branches all over America.  &quot;People like driving
round in the worst cars available,&quot; he said.  Of course they do.
	&quot;If a driver damages the side of a car and is honest enough to
admit it, I tell him, `Forget it&apos;.  If they bring a car back late we
overlook it.  If they&apos;ve had a crash and it doesn&apos;t involve another vehicle
we might overlook that too.&quot;
	&quot;Where&apos;s the ashtray?&quot; asked on Los Angeles wife, as she settled

open market.
	If a man would not labour in the salt and rock quarries then he
should not accept of the Earth that which he refuses to give of
himself.

	Such a man would expect a pear of a peach tree.
	Such a man would expect a stone to lay an egg.

ever raised into being for payment of any kind.  No parthenon, no Thermopylae
was ever built or fought for pay or glory; no Bukhara sacked, or China ground
beneath Mongol heel, for loot or power alone.  The payment for doing these
things was itself the doing of them.
	To wield onself -- to use oneself as a tool in one&apos;s own hand -- and
so to make or break that which no one else can build or ruin -- THAT is the
greatest pleasure known to man!  To one who has felt the chisel in his hand
and set free the angel prisoned in the marble block, or to one who has felt
sword in hand and set homeless the soul that a moment before lived in the body
of his mortal enemy -- to those both come alike the taste of that rare food
spread only for demons or for gods.&quot;

		<string>This is an especially good time for you vacationers who plan to fly, because
the Reagan administration, as part of the same policy under which it
recently sold Yellowstone National Park to Wayne Newton, has &quot;deregulated&quot;
the airline industry.  What this means for you, the consumer, is that the
airlines are no longer required to follow any rules whatsoever.  They can
show snuff movies.  They can charge for oxygen.  They can hire pilots right
out of Vending Machine Refill Person School.  They can conserve fuel by
ejecting husky passengers over water.  They can ram competing planes in
mid-air.  These innovations have resulted in tremendous cost savings which
have been passed along to you, the consumer, in the form of flights with
amazingly low fares, such as $29.  Of course, certain restrictions do apply,
the main one being that all these flights take you to Newark, and you must
pay thousands of dollars if you want to fly back out.

		<string>This planet has -- or rather had -- a problem, which was this:  most of
the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.  Many

which is odd because on the whole it wasn&apos;t the small green pieces of
paper that were unhappy.

		<string>To understand this important story, you have to understand how the telephone
company works.  Your telephone is connected to a local computer, which is in
turn connected to a regional computer, which is in turn connected to a
loudspeaker the size of a garbage truck on the lawn of Edna A. Bargewater of
Lawrence, Kan.

Whenever you talk on the phone, your local computer listens in.  If it
suspects you&apos;re going to discuss an intimate topic, it notifies the computer
above it, which listens in and decides whether to alert the one above it,
until finally, if you really humiliate yourself, maybe break down in tears
and tell your closest friend about a sordid incident from your past
involving a seedy motel, a neighbor&apos;s spouse, an entire religious order, a
garden hose and six quarts of tapioca pudding, the top computer feeds your
conversation into Edna&apos;s loudspeaker, and she and her friends come out on
the porch to listen and drink gin and laugh themselves silly.

		<string>Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an
infinitely large Universe, such as the one in which we live, most things one
could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow
somewhere.  A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew
ratchet screwdrivers as fruit.  The life cycle of the ratchet screwdriver is
quite interesting.  Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can
lie undisturbed for years.  Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its
outer skin that crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable
little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a hole
for a screw.  This, when found, will get thrown away.  No one knows what the
screwdriver is supposed to gain from this.  Nature, in her infinite wisdom,
is presumably working on it.

		<string>	We have some absolutely irrefutable statistics to show exactly why

	There are not as many people actually working as you may have thought.
	The population of this country is 200 million.  84 million are over
60 years of age, which leaves 116 million to do the work.  People under 20
years of age total 75 million, which leaves 41 million to do the work.
	There are 22 million who are employed by the government, which leaves
19 million to do the work.  Four million are in the Armed Services, which
leaves 15 million to do the work.  Deduct 14,800,000, the number in the state
and city offices, leaving 200,000 to do the work.  There are 188,000 in
hospitals, insane asylums, etc., so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.
	Now it may interest you to know that there are 11,998 people in jail,
so that leaves just 2 people to carry the load. That is you and me, and

&quot;I recommend this candidate with no qualifications whatsoever.&quot;
	(Yes, that about sums it up.)
&quot;The amount of mathematics she knows will surprise you.&quot;
	(And I recommend not giving that school a dime...)
&quot;I simply can&apos;t say enough good things about him.&quot;
	(What a screw-up.)
&quot;I am pleased to say that this candidate is a former colleague of mine.&quot;
	(I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am that she left our firm.)
&quot;When this person left our employ, we were quite hopeful he would go
a long way with his skills.&quot;
	(We hoped he&apos;d go as far as possible.)
&quot;You won&apos;t find many people like her.&quot;
	(In fact, most people can&apos;t stand being around her.)
&quot;I cannot reccommend him too highly.&quot;
	(However, to the best of my knowledge, he has never committed a
	 felony in my presence.)

		<string>What they said:
	What they meant:

&quot;If you knew this person as well as I know him, you would think as much
of him as I do.&quot;
	(Or as little, to phrase it slightly more accurately.)
&quot;Her input was always critical.&quot;
	(She never had a good word to say.)
&quot;I have no doubt about his capability to do good work.&quot;
	(And it&apos;s nonexistent.)
&quot;This candidate would lend balance to a department like yours, which
already has so many outstanding members.&quot;
	(Unless you already have a moron.)
&quot;His presentation to my seminar last semester was truly remarkable:
one unbelievable result after another.&quot;
	(And we didn&apos;t believe them, either.)
&quot;She is quite uniform in her approach to any function you may assign her.&quot;
	(In fact, to life in general...)
</string>
		<string>What they said:
	What they meant:

&quot;You will be fortunate if you can get him to work for you.&quot;
	(We certainly never succeeded.)
There is no other employee with whom I can adequately compare him.
	(Well, our rats aren&apos;t really employees...)
&quot;Success will never spoil him.&quot;
	(Well, at least not MUCH more.)
&quot;One usually comes away from him with a good feeling.&quot;
	(And such a sigh of relief.)
&quot;His dissertation is the sort of work you don&apos;t expect to see these days;
in it he has definitely demonstrated his complete capabilities.&quot;
	(And his IQ, as well.)
&quot;He should go far.&quot;
	(The farther the better.)
&quot;He will take full advantage of his staff.&quot;
	(He even has one of them mowing his lawn after work.)

	The man scratches his head.  &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;ll go
check.&quot; 
	Back, after an animated conversation with the other occupants of the
truck, he reassures the clerk, that, yes, in fact, two-by-fours would be
acceptable.
	&quot;OK,&quot; says the clerk, writing it down, &quot;how long you want &apos;em?&quot;
	The guy gets the blank look again.  &quot;Uh... I guess I better go
check,&quot; he says.
	He goes back out to the truck, and there&apos;s another animated

	Actually, I think my fear of yams began in my early youth, when many
of my young comrades pelted me with same for singing songs of far-off lands
and deep blue seas in a language closely resembling that of the common sow.
My psychosis was further impressed into my soul as I reached adolescence,
when, while skipping through a field of yams, light-heartedly tossing flowers
into the stratosphere, a great yam-picking machine tore through the fields,
pursuing me to the edge of the great plantation, where I escaped by diving
into a great ditch filled with a mixture of water and pig manure, which may
explain my tendency to scream, &quot;Here come the Martians!  Hide the eggs!&quot; every
time I have pork.  But I digress.  The fact remains that I cannot rationally
deal with yams, and pigs are terrible conversationalists.

to speak.  One morning when the child was five, while the husband was reading
the paper, and the wife was feeding the dog, the little kid looks up from
his bowl and said, &quot;My cereal&apos;s cold.&quot;

This is easy.  You never have to figure out what to get for children,
because they will tell you exactly what they want.  They spend months and
months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday- morning
cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children exactly what
they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices.  If your child thinks
he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You Can Rip Right Off, you&apos;d
better get it.  You may be worried that it might help to encourage your
child&apos;s antisocial tendencies, but believe me, you have not seen antisocial
tendencies until you&apos;ve seen a child who is convinced that he or she did not
get the right gift.

of while he showers.  Then I hop right back into the stall because our dog,
Earnest, who has been alone in the basement all night building up powerful
dog emotions, has come bounding and quivering into the bathroom and wants
to greet me with 60 or 70 thousand playful nips, any one of which -- bear
in mind that I am naked and, without my contact lenses, essentially blind
-- could result in the kind of injury where you have to learn a whole new
part if you want to sing the &quot;Messiah,&quot; if you get my drift.  Then I hop
right back out, because Robert, with that uncanny sixth sense some children
have -- you cannot teach it; they either have it or they don&apos;t -- has chosen
exactly that moment to flush one of the toilets.  Perhaps several of them.

		<string>	On this morning in August when I was 13, my mother sent us out pick
tomatoes.  Back in April I&apos;d have killed for a fresh tomato, but in August
they are no more rare or wonderful than rocks.  So I picked up one and threw
it at a crab apple tree, where it made a good *splat*, and then threw a tomato
at my brother.  He whipped one back at me.  We ducked down by the vines,
heaving tomatoes at each other.  My sister, who was a good person, said,
&quot;You&apos;re going to get it.&quot;  She bent over and kept on picking.
	What a target!  She was 17, a girl with big hips, and bending over,
she looked like the side of a barn.
	I picked up a tomato so big it sat on the ground.  It looked like it
had sat there a week.  The underside was brown, small white worms lived in it,
and it was very juicy.  I stood up and took aim, and went into the windup,
when my mother at the kitchen window called my name in a sharp voice.  I had
to decide quickly.  I decided.
	A rotten Big Boy hitting the target is a memorable sound, like a fat
man doing a belly-flop.  With a whoop and a yell the tomatoee came after
faster than I knew she could run, and grabbed my shirt and was about to brain
me when Mother called her name in a sharp voice.  And my sister, who was a
good person, obeyed and let go -- and burst into tears.  I guess she knew that
the pleasure of obedience is pretty thin compared with the pleasure of hearing
a rotten tomato hit someone in the rear end.

		<string>Gentlemen,
	Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the
approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship
from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters.
	We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles,
and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty&apos;s Government holds
me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and
spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted
for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence.
	Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains
unaccounted for in one infantry battalion&apos;s petty cash and there has been
a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to
one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain.  This
reprehensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance,
since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise
to you gentlemen in Whitehall.
	This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government so that I
may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains.
I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as
given below.  I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but
I cannot do both:
	1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the
benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance:
	2. To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain.

	Let me begin by reassuring you that my remarks today will stand up
to the most stringent requirements of the new appropriateness.
	The intra-college sensitivity advisory committee has vetted the
text of even trace amounts of subconscious racism, sexism and classism.
	Moreover, a faculty panel of deconstructionists have reconfigured
the rhetorical components within a post-structuralist framework, so as to
expunge any offensive elements of western rationalism and linear logic.
	Finally, all references flowing from a white, male, eurocentric
perspective have been eliminated, as have any other ruminations deemed
denigrating to the political consensus of the moment.

	Thank you and good luck.

		<string>History has much to say on following the proper procedures.  From a history
of the Mexican revolution:
	&quot;Hidalgo was later defeated at Guadalajara.  The rebel army was
captured on its way through the mountains.  All were courtmartialed and
shot, except Hidalgo, because he was a priest.  He was handed over to
the bishop of Durango who excommunicated him and returned him to the
army where he was then executed.&quot;

		<string>History is on our side (as long as we can control the historians).

		<string>History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree on.
		-- Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;Maxims&quot;

		<string>History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,
periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts them
asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing grub, at
intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...  Truly the imago
state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult is a step gained.

		-- Michael McShane
</string>
		<string>I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as
the greatest of dangers to be feared.  To preserve our independence, we must
not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.  If we run into such debts, we

in our labor and in our amusements.  If we can prevent the government from
wasting the labor of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they
will be happy.

		<string>I realize that the MX missile is none of our concern.  I realize that the
whole point of living in a democracy is that we pay professional
congresspersons to concern themselves with things like the MX missile so we

But from time to time, I feel I must address major public issues such as
this, because in a free and open society, where the very future of the world
hinges on decisions made by our elected leaders, you never win large cash
journalism awards if you stick to the topics I usually write about, such as
nose-picking.

</string>
		<string>I used to be a rebel in my youth.

This cause... that cause... (chuckle) I backed &apos;em ALL!  But I learned.
Rebellion is simply a device used by the immature to hide from his own
problems.  So I lost interest in politics.  Now when I feel aroused by
a civil rights case or a passport hearing... I realize it&apos;s just a device.
I go to my analyst and we work it out.  You have no idea how much better

		-- Martin Luther King, Jr.
</string>
		<string>I was appalled by this story of the destruction of a member of a valued
endangered species.  It&apos;s all very well to celebrate the practicality of
pigs by ennobling the porcine sibling who constructed his home out of
bricks and mortar.  But to wantonly destroy a wolf, even one with an
excessive taste for porkers, is unconscionable in these ecologically
critical times when both man and his domestic beasts continue to maraud
the earth.
		Sylvia Kamerman, &quot;Book Reviewing&quot;
</string>
		<string>I was offered a job as a hoodlum and I turned it down cold.  A thief is
anybody who gets out and works for his living, like robbing a bank or
breaking into a place and stealing stuff, or kidnapping somebody.  He really
gives some effort to it.  A hoodlum is a pretty lousy sort of scum.  He
works for gangsters and bumps guys off when they have been put on the spot.
Why, after I&apos;d made my rep, some of the Chicago Syndicate wanted me to work
for them as a hood -- you know, handling a machine gun.  They offered me
two hundred and fifty dollars a week and all the protection I needed.  I
was on the lam at the time and not able to work at my regular line.  But
I wouldn&apos;t consider it.  &quot;I&apos;m a thief,&quot; I said.  &quot;I&apos;m no lousy hoodlum.&quot;

		<string>	Once there was a marine biologist who loved dolphins. He spent his
time trying to feed and protect his beloved creatures of the sea.  One day,
in a fit of inventive genius, he came up with a serum that would make
dolphins live forever!
	Of course he was ecstatic. But he soon realized that in order to mass
produce this serum he would need large amounts of a certain compound that was
only found in nature in the metabolism of a rare South American bird.  Carried
away by his love for dolphins, he resolved that he would go to the zoo and
steal one of these birds.
	Unbeknownst to him, as he was arriving at the zoo an elderly lion was
escaping from its cage.  The zookeepers were alarmed and immediately began
combing the zoo for the escaped animal, unaware that it had simply lain down
on the sidewalk and had gone to sleep.
	Meanwhile, the marine biologist arrived at the zoo and procured his
bird.  He was so excited by the prospect of helping his dolphins that he
stepped absentmindedly stepped over the sleeping lion on his way back to his
car.  Immediately, 1500 policemen converged on him and arrested him for
transporting a myna across a staid lion for immortal porpoises.

		<string>Once upon a time there was a kingdom ruled by a great bear.  The peasants
were not very rich, and one of the few ways to become at all wealthy was
to become a Royal Knight.  This required an interview with the bear.  If
the bear liked you, you were knighted on the spot.  If not, the bear would
just as likely remove your head with one swat of a paw.  However, the family
of these unfortunate would-be knights was compensated with a beautiful
sheepdog from the royal kennels, which was itself a fairly valuable
possession.  And the moral of the story is:
 
The mourning after a terrible knight, nothing beats the dog of the bear that
hit you.

Six?  It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era -- the kind of peak that
never comes again.  San Fransisco in the middle sixties was a very special time
and place to be a part of.  Maybe it meant something.  Maybe not, in the long
run...  There was madness in any direction, at any hour.  If not across the
Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda...  You could
strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we
were doing was right, that we were winning...
	And that, I think, was the handle -- that sense of inevitable victory
over the forces of Old and Evil.  Not in any mean or military sense; we didn&apos;t
need that. Our energy would simply prevail.  There was no point in fighting
-- on our side or theirs.  We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest
of a high and beautiful wave.  So now, less than five years later, you can go

you can almost ___see the high-water mark -- that place where the wave finally

		<string>The Least Successful Executions
	History has furnished us with two executioners worthy of attention.
The first performed in Sydney in Australia.  In 1803 three attempts were
made to hang a Mr. Joseph Samuels.  On the first two of these the rope
snapped, while on the third Mr. Samuels just hung there peacefully until he
and everyone else got bored.  Since he had proved unsusceptible to capital
punishment, he was reprieved.
	The most important British executioner was Mr. James Berry who
tried three times in 1885 to hang Mr. John Lee at Exeter Jail, but on each
occasion failed to get the trap door open.
	In recognition of this achievement, the Home Secretary commuted
Lee&apos;s sentence to &quot;life&quot; imprisonment.  He was released in 1917, emigrated
to America and lived until 1933.

		<string>The Least Successful Police Dogs
	America has a very strong candidate in &quot;La Dur&quot;, a fearsome looking
schnauzer hound, who was retired from the Orlando police force in Florida
in 1978.  He consistently refused to do anything which might ruffle or
offend the criminal classes.
	His handling officer, Rick Grim, had to admit: &quot;He just won&apos;t go up
and bite them.  I got sick and tired of doing that dog&apos;s work for him.&quot;
	The British contenders in this category, however, took things a
stage further.  &quot;Laddie&quot; and &quot;Boy&quot; were trained as detector dogs for drug
raids.  Their employment was terminated following a raid in the Midlands in
1967.
	While the investigating officer questioned two suspects, they
patted and stroked the dogs who eventually fell asleep in front of the
fire.  When the officer moved to arrest the suspects, one dog growled at
him while the other leapt up and bit his thigh.

The day has gone down in New England history as a terrible foretaste of

men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came.
The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session.  And, as some of
the men fell down and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the
Speaker of the House, one Col. Davenport, came to his feet.  He silenced
them and said these words: &quot;The day of judgment is either approaching or

		<string>The Worst Bank Robbery
	In August 1975 three men were on their way in to rob the Royal Bank of
Scotland at Rothesay, when they got stuck in the revolving doors.  They
had to be helped free by the staff and, after thanking everyone,
sheepishly left the building.
	A few minutes later they returned and announced their intention of
robbing the bank, but none of the staff believed them.  When they demanded
5,000 pounds in cash, the head cashier laughed at them, convinced that it
was a practical joke.
	Then one of the men jumped over the counter, but fell to the floor
clutching his ankle.  The other two tried to make their getaway, but got
trapped in the revolving doors again.

		<string>The Worst Prison Guards
	The largest number of convicts ever to escape simultaneously from a
maximum security prison is 124.  This record is held by Alcoente Prison,
near Lisbon in Portugal.
	During the weeks leading up to the escape in July 1978 the prison
warders had noticed that attendances had fallen at film shows which
included &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, and also that 220 knives and a huge quantity
of electric cable had disappeared.  A guard explained, &quot;Yes, we were
planning to look for them, but never got around to it.&quot;  The warders had
not, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were
&quot;covered with posters&quot;.  Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,
water hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.
The night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36
prisoners in his block only 13 were present.  He said this was &quot;normal&quot;
because inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back
the next morning.
	&quot;We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when
one of the prisoners told us,&quot; a warder said later.  [...]  When they
eventually checked, the prison guards found that exactly half of the gaol&apos;s
population was missing.  By way of explanation the Justice Minister, Dr.
Santos Pais, claimed that the escape was &quot;normal&quot; and part of the
&quot;legitimate desire of the prisoner to regain his liberty.&quot;

		<string>Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers
in heavy weather for several days.  I was serving on the lead battleship and
was on watch on the bridge as night fell.  The visibility was poor with patchy
fog, so the Captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities.
	Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported,
&quot;Light, bearing on the starboard bow.&quot;
	&quot;Is it steady or moving astern?&quot; the Captain called out.
	Lookout replied, &quot;Steady, Captain,&quot; which meant we were on a dangerous
collision course with that ship.
	The Captain then called to the signalman, &quot;Signal that ship: We are on
a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	Back came a signal &quot;Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	In reply, the Captain said, &quot;Send: I&apos;m a Captain, change course 20
degrees!&quot;
	&quot;I&apos;m a seaman second class,&quot; came the reply, &quot;You had better change
course 20 degrees.&quot;
	By that time, the Captain was furious. He spit out, &quot;Send: I&apos;m a
battleship, change course 20 degrees.&quot;
	Back came the flashing light: &quot;I&apos;m a lighthouse!&quot;
	We changed course.

		<string>What does it take for Americans to do great things; to go to the moon, to
win wars, to dig canals linking oceans, to build railroads across a continent?
In independent thought about this question, Neil Armstrong and I concluded
that it takes a coincidence of four conditions, or in Neil&apos;s view, the
simultaneous peaking of four of the many cycles of American life.  First, a
base of technology must exist from which to do the thing to be done.  Second,
a period of national uneasiness about America&apos;s place in the scheme of human
activities must exist.  Third, some catalytic event must occur that focuses
the national attention upon the direction to proceed.  Finally, an articulate
and wise leader must sense these first three conditions and put forth with
words and action the great thing to be accomplished.  The motivation of young
Americans to do what needs to be done flows from such a coincidence of
conditions. ...  The Thomas Jeffersons, The Teddy Roosevelts, The John
Kennedys appear.  We must begin to create the tools of leadership which they,
and their young frontiersmen, will require to lead us onward and upward.

		<string>You first have to decide whether to use the short or the long form. The
short form is what the Internal Revenue Service calls &quot;simplified&quot;, which
means it is designed for people who need the help of a Sears tax-preparation
expert to distinguish between their first and last names.  Here&apos;s the
complete text:

&quot;(1) How much did you make?  (AMOUNT)
(2) How much did we here at the government take out?  (AMOUNT)
(3) Hey!  Sounds like we took too much!  So we&apos;re going to
     send an official government check for (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF
     THE AMOUNT WE TOOK) directly to the (YOUR LAST NAME)
     household at (YOUR ADDRESS), for you to spend in any way
     you please! Which just goes to show you, (YOUR FIRST
     NAME), that it pays to file the short form!&quot;

The IRS wants you to use this form because it gets to keep most of your
money.  So unless you have pond silt for brains, you want the long form.

cash skimming by proprietors and tradesmen, &quot;moonlighting&quot; services,
